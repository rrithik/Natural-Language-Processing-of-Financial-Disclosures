#  How to Run the Project

This repository contains the initial **text scraping pipeline** for our *Natural Language Processing of Financial Disclosures* project.  
The scraper reads a local `.txt` file (e.g., SEC 8-K filing) and extracts all text content for topic analysis.

##  Setup & Execution
Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/rrithik/Natural-Language-Processing-of-Financial-Disclosures.git
cd Natural-Language-Processing-of-Financial-Disclosures`

Prepare your input file:

Place your `.txt` document (for example: sample_8K.txt) inside the project folder.
Open the scraper script (e.g., scraper_basic.py) and update the filename variable at the top of the file to match your document name:
file_name = "sample_8K.txt"
### Run the scraper:
`python scraper_basic.py`
### View output:

The program will print the extracted text or save it to an output file (depending on the current configuration).
