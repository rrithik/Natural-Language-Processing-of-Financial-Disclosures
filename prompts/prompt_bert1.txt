You are an expert financial analyst. Analyze the following financial document.

It is BERTopic analysis of a financial document.  
The format is as follows:

Topic 0 | chunks=101
Label: 0_report_communications_number_commission
Top words: report, communications, number, commission, commencement, date, address, former, code, name

Topic 1 | chunks=81
Label: 1_gaap_operating_fiscal_loss
Top words: gaap, operating, fiscal, loss, quarter, excluded, income, performance, amortization, assets

...

Below this section you will also see an summary for each topic, such as:
(0, '0.047*"report" + 0.044*"communications" + 0.043*"number" + ...)

For each topic:
- The topic ID appears before the parenthesis.
- Inside each parenthesis, a list of word-weight pairs shows the weight of each word in that topic.

Your tasks:

===============================================================================
1. Calculate topic proportions
===============================================================================
For each topic ID, calculate the **topic proportion** by summing the weights of all words listed for that topic in the parenthesis version.

===============================================================================
2. Make table of topics
===============================================================================
Add each selected topic to a table in this format:

| Topic ID | FileName | Date | Topic Number | Topic Proportion |

Use placeholder fields:
- FileName: use the filename provided or write "Unknown" if none provided.
- Date: use the date provided or write "Unknown".

===============================================================================
3. Create the topic-name key table
===============================================================================
Using the word lists associated with each chosen topic, infer a concise financial topic name (e.g., “GAAP Operating Losses”, “Loan Credit Facility”, “Forward-Looking Statements”, etc.)

Format the table like this:

| Topic Number | Topic Name | Topic Description |

===============================================================================
4. Output
===============================================================================
Print:
1. The first table (topics over the threshold)
2. The second table (topic names)
