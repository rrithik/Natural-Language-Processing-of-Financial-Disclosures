exchange offers ) in order to provide you with an opportunity to exchange your original notes for exchange notes that have been registered under the Securities Act. The original notes and the exchange notes are sometimes referred
to in this prospectus together as the notes . Material Terms of the Exchange Offers: 

The Issuer will exchange all original notes that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn for an equal
principal amount of exchange notes that are freely tradable.

You may withdraw tenders of original notes at any time prior to the expiration of the relevant exchange offer.

Each exchange offer will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on , 2019 (the
expiration date ), unless extended. We do not currently intend to extend the expiration date unless required to do so by applicable law as described under The Exchange OffersExpiration Date; Extensions;
Amendments .

The original notes may only be tendered in an amount equal to $2,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples
of $1,000 in excess thereof.

To exchange your original notes, you are required to make certain representations to us. See The Exchange
OffersProcedures for Tendering for more information.

We will not receive any proceeds from the exchange offers.

The Exchange Notes: 
The terms of the exchange notes to be issued in the exchange offers are substantially identical to the terms of
the corresponding series of original notes, except that the exchange notes will be registered under the Securities Act and the transfer restrictions, registration rights and additional interest provisions applicable to the original notes will not
apply to the exchange notes. The exchange notes will represent the same debt as the original notes, and the Issuer will issue the exchange notes under the same indenture that governs the applicable series of original notes.

The exchange notes will be fully, unconditionally, jointly and severally guaranteed on an unsecured unsubordinated
basis by the same entity that guarantees the original notes, specifically TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp. (the Guarantor or TWDC Enterprises ). The guarantee constitutes a separate security that is being offered by the
Guarantor. See Description of NotesThe Guarantee .

The exchange notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or any automated dealer quotation system and
there is currently no market for the exchange notes.
All untendered original notes will continue to be subject to the restrictions on
transfer set forth in the original notes and in the indenture governing the applicable series of original notes. In general, the original notes may not be offered or sold, unless registered under the Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, registration under the Securities Act. Other than in connection with the exchange offers, the Issuer does not currently anticipate that it will register any series of the original notes under the Securities
Act. Each broker-dealer that receives exchange notes for its own account pursuant to an exchange offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus
in connection with any resale of such exchange notes. The letter of transmittal states that, by so acknowledging and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an underwriter within the meaning of
the Securities Act. This prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of exchange notes received in exchange for original notes where such original notes were acquired
by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. The Issuer has agreed that it will furnish to each broker-dealer who has delivered the notice to the Issuer required by and in accordance with the
registration rights agreement (as defined herein), without charge, as many copies of this prospectus and any amendment and supplement hereto, as such participating broker-dealer may reasonably request in connection with its resale of such exchange
notes. See Plan of Distribution . Investing in the exchange notes involves risks. See Risk Factors
beginning on page 16 for a discussion of certain factors you should consider in connection with the exchange offers and an investment in the exchange notes. 
Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these
securities or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. The
date of this prospectus is , 2019.

The original notes may only be tendered in an amount equal to $2,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. See The Exchange OffersTerms of the Exchange
Offers .

In order to exchange an Original Note, you must follow the required procedures, and the Issuer must accept the Original Note for exchange. The Issuer will exchange all original notes validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn prior to the expiration date. See The Exchange Offers .

Resale of Exchange Notes Based on interpretations of the SEC staff, as described in previous no-action letters issued to third parties, we believe that the exchange notes you receive pursuant to the exchange offers in exchange for
the original notes may be offered for resale, resold and otherwise transferred without compliance with the registration and prospectus delivery provisions of the Securities Act, provided that:

you are acquiring the exchange notes issued in the exchange offers in the ordinary course of your business;

you have not engaged in, do not intend to engage in, and have no arrangement or understanding with any person to
participate in the distribution, as defined in the Securities Act, of the exchange notes you will receive in the exchange offers; and

you are not an affiliate of the Issuer or the Guarantor, as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities
Act.

By tendering your original notes as described in The Exchange OffersProcedures for Tendering , you will be making representations to this effect. If you fail to satisfy any of these conditions,
you cannot rely on the position of the SEC set forth in the no-action letters referred to above and you must comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act in
connection with a resale of the exchange notes.

We base our belief on interpretations by the SEC staff in no-action letters issued to other issuers in exchange offers like ours. We cannot guarantee that the SEC would make a
similar decision about our exchange offers. If our belief is wrong, you could incur liability under the Securities Act. We will not protect you against any loss incurred as a result of this liability under the Securities Act.

Each broker-dealer that receives exchange notes for its own account in exchange for original notes, where such original notes
were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities, must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in

7 

Table of Contents 

connection with any resale of the exchange notes. The Issuer has agreed that it will furnish to each broker-dealer who has delivered the notice to the Issuer required by and in accordance with
the registration rights agreement, without charge, as many copies of this prospectus and any amendment and supplement hereto, as such participating broker-dealer may reasonably request in connection with its resale of such exchange notes. See
Plan of Distribution .

Consequences if You Do Not Exchange Your Original Notes Original notes that are not tendered in the exchange offers or are not accepted for exchange will continue to be subject to transfer restrictions. You will not be able to offer or sell such original notes unless you are able to rely on an
exemption from the requirements of the Securities Act or the original notes are registered under the Securities Act.

After the exchange offers are completed, the Issuer will no longer have an obligation to register the original notes, except under limited circumstances. To the extent that original notes are tendered and accepted in
the exchange offers, the market for any remaining original notes will be adversely affected. See Risk FactorsRisks Relating to the Exchange OffersIf you fail to exchange your original notes, they will continue to be restricted
securities and may become less liquid .

Expiration Date Each exchange offer expires at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on , 2019, subject to our right to extend the expiration date for any exchange offer. See The Exchange OffersExpiration Date; Extensions;
Amendments .

Issuance of Exchange Notes The Issuer will issue exchange notes in exchange for original notes tendered and accepted in the exchange offers promptly following the applicable expiration date (unless amended as described in this prospectus). See The Exchange
OffersTerms of the Exchange Offers .

Conditions to the Exchange Offers The exchange offers are subject to certain customary conditions, which we may amend or waive. The exchange offers are not conditioned upon any minimum principal amount of outstanding original notes being tendered. See The Exchange
OffersConditions to the Exchange Offers .

Special Procedures for Beneficial Holders If you beneficially own original notes which are registered in the name of a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee and you
wish to tender in the exchange offers, you should contact the registered holder promptly and instruct such person to tender on your behalf. If you wish to tender in the exchange offers on your own behalf, you must, prior to completing and executing
the letter of transmittal and delivering your original notes, either arrange to have the original notes registered in your name or obtain a properly

completed bond power from the registered holder. The transfer of registered ownership may take a considerable amount of time. See The Exchange OffersProcedures for
Tendering .

Withdrawal Rights You may withdraw your tender of original notes at any time before the expiration date for the applicable exchange offer. See The Exchange OffersWithdrawal of Tenders .

Accounting Treatment We will not recognize any gain or loss for accounting related to the exchange offers. We will record the expenses of the exchange offers as incurred. See The Exchange OffersAccounting Treatment .

Federal Income Tax Consequences The exchange of original notes for exchange notes pursuant to the exchange offers generally will not be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations .

Use of Proceeds We will not receive any proceeds from the issuance of exchange notes in connection with the exchange offers.

reporting covenant. Each covenant is subject to a number of important exceptions, limitations and qualifications that are described under Description of NotesCertain Covenants .

The guarantee will be the Guarantors senior unsecured obligation and will rank pari passu with all of its other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding and will be
effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

Risk Factors For certain risks related to the exchange notes and the exchange offers, please read the section entitled Risk Factors beginning on page 16 of this prospectus.

15 

Table of Contents 

RISK FACTORS 
You should carefully consider all the information set forth in this prospectus and incorporated by reference herein before deciding to participate in the
exchange offers. Your investment in the notes involves certain risks. In consultation with your own financial, tax and legal advisors, you should carefully consider, among other matters, the following discussion of risks before deciding whether an
investment in the notes is suitable for you. The notes are not an appropriate investment for you if you are unsophisticated with respect to their significant components. 
General For an enterprise as large and
complex as The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiaries are, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. The most significant factors affecting the operations of The Walt Disney Company together with its
subsidiaries include those set out in Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 29, 2018 and in any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 29, 2018 filed by TWDC Enterprises) and Annual
Reports on Form 10-K under Item 1A, Risk Factors as well as in any subsequent periodic or current reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act that include Risk
Factors or that discuss risks to us. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider these risks, as well as any other information that we include or incorporate by reference in this prospectus. Additional factors
relevant to the exchange offers and the notes include the following. Risks Relating to the Exchange Offers 
If you fail to exchange your original notes, they will continue to be restricted securities and may become less liquid. 
Original notes that you do not tender or the Issuer does not accept will, following the exchange offers, continue to be restricted securities, and may not be
offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. 
Because we anticipate that most holders of original notes will elect to exchange their original notes, we expect that the liquidity of the market for any
original notes remaining after the completion of the exchange offers will be substantially limited. Any original notes tendered and exchanged in the exchange offers will reduce the aggregate principal amount of the original notes of the applicable
series outstanding. Following the exchange offers, if you do not tender your original notes you generally will not have any further registration rights, and your original notes will continue to be subject to certain transfer restrictions.
Accordingly, the liquidity of the market for the original notes could be adversely affected. If you are a broker-dealer, your ability to transfer
the exchange notes may be restricted. A broker-dealer that acquired the original notes for its own account as a result of market-making activities
or other trading activities must comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of the exchange notes. The Issuers obligation to make this prospectus available to broker-dealers is limited.
Consequently, we cannot guarantee that a proper prospectus will be available to broker-dealers wishing to resell their exchange notes. There may
not be any trading market for the exchange notes; many factors affect the trading and market value of the exchange notes. The exchange notes are a
new issue of securities and, upon issuance, your exchange notes will not have an established trading market. The Issuer does not intend to apply for listing or quotation of the exchange notes on any securities exchange or on any automated quotation
system. The Issuer cannot assure you a trading market for 
16 

Table of Contents 

your exchange notes will ever develop or be maintained if developed. Furthermore, the Issuer cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any trading market that may develop for any of the exchange
notes, whether you will be able to sell the exchange notes, or the prices at which you may be able to sell the exchange notes. In addition to the Issuers creditworthiness, many factors will affect the trading market for, and trading value of,
your exchange notes. These factors include the risk factors described and referred to elsewhere in this Risk Factors section and the following: 
the interest rate on the exchange notes;

the time remaining to the maturity of the exchange notes;

the outstanding amount of the exchange notes;

the redemption features of certain of the exchange notes;

the level, direction and volatility of market interest rates generally;

market perceptions of the level, direction and volatility of interest rates generally; and

the trading value of comparable securities.

There may be a limited number of buyers when you decide to sell your exchange notes. This may affect the price you receive for your exchange notes or your
ability to sell your exchange notes at all. Risks Relating to the Notes 
There may not be any trading market for your notes; many factors affect the trading and market value of your notes. 
The notes are a new issue of securities and, upon issuance, your notes will not have an established trading market. We do not intend to apply for listing or
quotation of the notes on any securities exchange or on any automated quotation system. We cannot assure you a trading market for your notes will ever develop or be maintained if developed. Furthermore, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of
any trading market that may develop for any of the notes, whether you will be able to sell the notes, or the prices at which you may be able to sell the notes. In addition to our creditworthiness, many factors will affect the trading market for, and
trading value of, your notes. These factors include the risk factors described and referred to elsewhere in this Risk Factors section and the following: 
the interest rate on the notes;

the time remaining to the maturity of the notes;

the outstanding amount of the notes;

the redemption features of the notes;

the level, direction and volatility of market interest rates generally;

market perceptions of the level, direction and volatility of interest rates generally; and

the trading value of comparable securities.

There may be a limited number of buyers when you decide to sell your notes. This may affect the price you receive for your notes or your ability to sell your
notes at all. You should not purchase the notes unless you understand and know you can bear all of the investment risks involving your notes.

The Walt Disney Company is a holding company, and the notes will be structurally subordinated to the
indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries, other than the Guarantor. The guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of the Guarantors subsidiaries. 
The notes are our obligations exclusively and not of any of our subsidiaries. The guarantee is the Guarantors obligation exclusively and not any of its
subsidiaries. Operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries. Our and the Guarantors subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any amounts due under the notes or the guarantee or to make any
funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. Except to the extent we or the Guarantor are a creditor with recognized claims against our or the Guarantors subsidiaries, all claims of creditors (including trade
creditors) of our or the Guarantors subsidiaries will have priority with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries over our or the Guarantors claims (and therefore the claims of our and the Guarantors creditors, including holders
of the notes). Consequently, the notes will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness or other liabilities of our subsidiaries other than the Guarantor, including any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish, and the
guarantee will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness or other liabilities of the Guarantors subsidiaries, including any subsidiaries that the Guarantor may in the future acquire or establish. 
Redemption prior to maturity may adversely affect your return on the Disney Redeemable Notes and the Disney Par Call Notes. 
Since the Disney Redeemable Notes and the Disney Par Call Notes are redeemable at our option, we may choose to redeem your notes at times when prevailing
interest rates are relatively low. As a result, you generally will not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on your notes being redeemed. 
Our and the Guarantors credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in the notes and a downgrade in our and/or the Guarantors
credit ratings could adversely affect the market value of the notes. The credit ratings that may be assigned to our outstanding debt securities
and to the notes do not purport to reflect the potential impact of all risks relating to an investment in those securities. Such ratings are limited in scope and reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating was issued. These
ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies or placed on a
so-called watch list for a possible downgrade or assigned a negative ratings outlook if, in any rating agencys judgment, circumstances so warrant. Moreover, these credit ratings are not
recommendations to buy, sell or hold any of our debt securities or the notes. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our or the Guarantors credit ratings may adversely affect any trading market for, and the market value of, the notes,
and also increase our borrowing costs. An increase in market interest rates could result in a decrease in the market value of the notes.
In general, as market interest rates rise, debt securities bearing interest at fixed rates of interest decline in value. Consequently, if you
purchase notes and market interest rates increase, the market value of those notes may decline. We cannot predict the future level of market interest rates.

USE OF PROCEEDS 
The exchange offers are intended to satisfy the Issuers and the Guarantors obligations under the registration rights agreement entered into in
connection with the issuance of the original notes. We will not receive any proceeds from the issuance of exchange notes in connection with the exchange offers. In consideration for issuing the exchange notes, the Issuer will receive the original
notes from you in like principal amount. The original notes surrendered in exchange for the exchange notes will be retired and canceled and cannot be reissued. Accordingly, issuance of the exchange notes will not result in any change in our
indebtedness other than to the extent that we incur any indebtedness in connection with the payment of expenses to be incurred in connection with the exchange offers, including the fees and expenses of the exchange agent and accounting and legal
fees.

THE EXCHANGE OFFERS 
Purpose of the Exchange Offers; Registration Rights In
connection with the prior private exchange offers, the Issuer and the Guarantor entered into a registration rights agreement with the dealer managers, under which the Issuer and the Guarantor agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to
be filed and have declared effective an exchange offer registration statement under the Securities Act and to consummate an exchange offer for each series of such exchange notes. The exchange offers are being made pursuant to the registration rights
agreement to satisfy the Issuers and the Guarantors obligations thereunder. We are making the exchange offers in reliance on the position of
the SEC as described in previous no-action letters issued to third parties. However, we have not sought our own no-action letter. Based upon these interpretations by the SEC, we believe that a holder of exchange notes who exchanges original notes
for exchange notes in the exchange offers generally may offer the exchange notes for resale, sell the exchange notes and otherwise transfer the exchange notes without further registration under the Securities Act and without delivery of a prospectus
that satisfies the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act. The preceding sentence does not apply, however, to a holder who is an affiliate of the Issuer or the Guarantor, as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act. We
also believe that a holder may offer, sell or transfer the exchange notes only if the holder acknowledges that the holder is acquiring the exchange notes in the ordinary course of its business and is not participating, does not intend to participate
and has no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in a distribution of the exchange notes. Each broker-dealer that receives exchange
notes for its own account in exchange for original notes, where such original notes were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities, must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in
connection with any resale of such exchange notes. This prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of exchange notes received in exchange for original notes where
such original notes were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. The letter of transmittal states that by acknowledging and delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be considered
to admit that it is an underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act. The Issuer has agreed that it will furnish to each broker-dealer who has delivered the notice to the Issuer required by and in accordance with the registration
rights agreement, without charge, as many copies of this prospectus and any amendment and supplement thereto, as such participating broker-dealer may reasonably request in connection with its resale of such exchange notes. See Plan of
Distribution . Except as described above, this prospectus may not be used for an offer to resell, resale or other transfer of exchange notes.
The exchange offers are not being made to, nor will we accept tenders for exchange from, holders of original notes in any jurisdiction in which the
exchange offers or the acceptance of it would not be in compliance with the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdiction. The registration rights
agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) file, no later than December 15, 2019, a registration statement with the SEC with respect to the exchange offers, (ii) cause such registration statement to be
declared effective and (iii) complete the registered exchange offers no later than June 17, 2020. Alternatively, under the circumstances set
forth below, the registration rights agreement requires us to, at our expense, (a) cause to be filed with the SEC a shelf registration statement covering resales of the original notes of the applicable series within 90 days of the date the
obligation to file a shelf registration statement arose and use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shelf registration statement to be declared effective within 
22 

Table of Contents 

270 days of the date the obligation to file a shelf registration statement arose and (b) use our commercially reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement effective until
the earlier of March 20, 2020 and the date all original notes covered by the shelf registration statement have been sold as contemplated in the shelf registration statement or have ceased to be outstanding or otherwise registrable, with certain
exceptions. These circumstances include if: 
changes in law or in applicable interpretations thereof by the staff of the SEC do not permit us to effect the
exchange offers;

the applicable exchange offer is not consummated by June 17, 2020; or

any holder notifies the Issuer that it is not permitted by applicable law to participate in the exchange offer or
participates in the exchange offer and does not receive fully tradable exchange notes pursuant to the exchange offer.
We will, in the
event of the filing of the shelf registration statement, provide to each holder of the original notes of the applicable series at least one conformed copy of each shelf registration statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including
financial statements and schedules, notify each such holder when the shelf registration statement has become effective and take certain other actions as are required to permit unrestricted resales of the original notes of such series. A holder of
original notes that sells its original notes pursuant to the shelf registration statement generally (1) will be required to be named as a selling security holder in the related prospectus and to deliver a prospectus to purchasers, (2) will
be subject to certain of the civil liability provisions under the Securities Act in connection with such sales and (3) will be bound by the provisions of the applicable registration rights agreement that are applicable to such a holder
(including certain indemnification rights and obligations thereunder). In addition, each holder of the original notes will be required to deliver information as required by the registration rights agreement to have their original notes included in
the shelf registration statement and to benefit from the provisions regarding liquidated damages described in the following paragraph. If we do not
consummate the applicable exchange offer by June 17, 2020, the shelf registration statement is not declared effective within 270 days of the date the obligation to file a shelf registration statement arose or the shelf registration statement
ceases to be effective or usable for a period of time that exceeds 120 days in the aggregate in any 12-month period in which it is required to be effective under the registration rights agreement (each such event, a registration
default ) then, subject to the terms of the registration rights agreement, the interest rate borne by the applicable series of original notes will be increased by one quarter of one percent per annum for the first 90-day period while one or
more registration defaults is continuing and will increase to a maximum of one-half of one percent per annum while one or more registration defaults is continuing until all registration defaults have been cured. Upon the cure of all of the
registration defaults set forth above, the interest rate borne by the original notes of such series will be reduced to the original interest rate if we are otherwise in compliance with this paragraph; provided , however , that if, after
any such reduction in interest rate, certain events occur with respect to a different registration default, the interest rate on the applicable series of original notes may again be increased pursuant to the foregoing provisions. 
This summary of certain provisions of the registration rights agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety
by, the complete provisions of the registration rights agreement, each of which is incorporated by reference in this prospectus.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the exchange offers set forth in this prospectus and the accompanying letter
of transmittal, we will accept any and all original notes validly tendered prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the expiration date. Promptly after the expiration date (unless extended as described in this prospectus), the Issuer will issue
exchange notes for a like principal amount of outstanding original notes tendered and accepted in connection with the exchange offers. The exchange notes issued in connection with the exchange offers will be delivered promptly after the expiration
date. Holders may tender some or all of their original notes in connection with the exchange offers, but only in principal amounts of $2,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Holders who tender less than all of their original notes
must continue to hold original notes in at least a minimum denomination of $2,000. The terms of the exchange notes are substantially identical to the
terms of the corresponding series of the original notes, except that the exchange notes are registered under the Securities Act, and the transfer restrictions, registration rights and payment of additional interest in case of non-registration
applicable to the original notes do not apply to the exchange notes. The exchange notes will evidence the same debt as the original notes, and will be issued under the same indenture and be entitled to the same benefits under the indenture as the
original notes of the applicable series being exchanged. Except as described under Book-Entry, Delivery and Form , exchange notes will
be issued in the form of a global note registered in the name of the Depository Trust Company ( DTC ) or its nominee and each beneficial owners interest in it will be transferable in book-entry form through DTC. See
Book-Entry, Delivery and Form . Holders of original notes do not have any appraisal or dissenters rights in connection with the
exchange offers. We intend to conduct the exchange offers in accordance with the applicable requirements of Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act. Original notes that are not tendered for exchange or are tendered but not accepted in connection with
the exchange offers will remain outstanding and be entitled to the benefits of the indenture governing such original notes, but certain registration and other rights under the registration rights agreement will terminate and holders of the original
notes will generally not be entitled to any registration rights under the registration rights agreement. See Consequences of Failure to Properly Tender Original Notes in the Exchange Offers . 
We shall be considered to have accepted validly tendered original notes if and when we have given oral (to be followed by prompt written notice) or written
notice to the exchange agent. The exchange agent will act as agent for the tendering holders for the purposes of receiving the exchange notes from us. If
any tendered original notes are not accepted for exchange because of an invalid tender, the occurrence of certain other events described in this prospectus or otherwise, we will return the original notes, without expense, to the tendering holder
promptly after the expiration date for the exchange offers.

Table of Contents 

Holders who tender original notes will not be required to pay brokerage commissions or fees or, subject to
the instructions in the letter of transmittal, transfer taxes on exchange of original notes in connection with the exchange offers. We will pay all charges and expenses, other than certain applicable taxes described below, in connection with the
exchange offers. See Fees and Expenses . Expiration Date; Extensions; Amendments 
The expiration date for each of the exchange offers is 5:00 p.m., New York City time,
, 2019, unless we extend the expiration date for any exchange offer. We may extend this expiration date for any or all of the exchange offers in our
discretion, and the extension of any particular exchange offer will not result in an extension of any other exchange offer unless we so provide in the relevant notice of extension. If we so extend the expiration date for any exchange offer, the term
expiration date for such exchange offer shall mean the latest date and time to which we extend such exchange offer. We reserve the right to:

prior to the expiration date, delay accepting any original notes;

extend any exchange offer;

terminate any exchange offer if, in our reasonable judgment, any of the conditions described below under
Conditions to the Exchange Offers shall not have been satisfied or waived; or

amend the terms of the exchange offers in any way we determine.

We will give oral or written notice of any delay, extension or termination to the exchange agent. In addition, we will give, as promptly as practicable, oral
or written notice regarding any delay in acceptance, extension or termination of the offer to the registered holders of original notes. If we amend any exchange offer in a manner that we determine to constitute a material change, or if we waive a
material condition, we will promptly disclose the amendment or waiver in a manner reasonably calculated to inform the holders of original notes of the applicable series of the amendment or waiver, and extend the offer if required by law. 
If we materially change the terms of an exchange offer or the information concerning an exchange offer, or if we waive a material condition of an exchange
offer, we will extend such exchange offer to the extent required by (i) Exchange Act Rule 13e-4(e)(3) or (ii) Securities Act Rule 162(a)(2). Rule 13e-4(e)(3) requires that if a material change occurs in the information published, sent or
given to security holders, we must disseminate promptly disclosure of the change in a manner reasonably calculated to inform security holders of the change. In a registered securities offering such as the exchange offers, the offer must remain open
from the date that material changes to the exchange offer materials are disseminated to security holders, as follows: 
(i) five business days for a prospectus supplement containing a material change other than price or share levels;

(ii) ten business days for a prospectus supplement containing a change in price, the amount of securities sought,
the dealers soliciting fee, or other similarly significant change;

(iii) ten business days for a prospectus supplement included as part of a post-effective amendment; and

(iv) twenty business days for a revised prospectus when the initial prospectus was materially deficient.
Any extension, termination or amendment will be followed as promptly as practicable by a public announcement thereof, such announcement
in the case of an extension to be issued no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day. If we delay accepting any original notes
or terminate any exchange offer, we promptly will pay the consideration offered, or return any original notes deposited, pursuant to such exchange offer as required by Rule 14e-1(c).

Interest on the Exchange Notes 
With respect to each series of exchange notes, interest will accrue on such exchange notes from the most recent date to which interest on the respective
original notes has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the issue date of the respective original notes. Interest is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on the applicable dates for each series as described in Description of
Notes . If the regular record date for the first interest payment date of any series of exchange notes would be a date prior to the settlement date of the related exchange offer, the record date for such first interest payment date will be
the day immediately preceding such first interest payment date. Conditions to the Exchange Offers 
Notwithstanding any other term of the exchange offers, we will not be required to accept for exchange, or to exchange any exchange notes for, any original
notes and may terminate any or all of the exchange offers as provided in this prospectus before the acceptance of the original notes, if prior to the expiration date: 
the exchange offer, or the making of any exchange by a holder (as defined in the registration rights agreement),
violates applicable law or any applicable interpretation of the staff of the SEC;

any action or proceeding shall have been instituted or threatened in any court or by or before any governmental
agency with respect to the exchange offer which, in the Companys judgment, would reasonably be expected to impair the ability of the Company to proceed with the exchange offer;

we have not obtained any governmental approval which we, in our reasonable judgment, consider necessary for the
completion of the exchange offer as contemplated by this prospectus;

any change, or any condition, event or development involving a prospective change, shall have occurred or be
threatened in the general economic, financial, currency exchange or market conditions in the United States or elsewhere that, in our reasonable judgment, would impair our ability to proceed with the exchange offer;

any other change or development, including a prospective change or development, that, in our reasonable judgment,
has or may have a material adverse effect on us, the market price of the exchange notes or the original notes or the value of the exchange offer to us; or

there shall have occurred (i) any suspension or limitation of trading in securities generally on any
national securities exchange or the over-the-counter market; (ii) a declaration of a banking moratorium by United States Federal or New York authorities; or (iii) a commencement or escalation of a war or armed hostilities involving or
relating to a country where we do business or other international or national emergency or crisis directly or indirectly involving the United States.

The conditions listed above are for our benefit and may be asserted by us regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any of these conditions. We may waive
these conditions in whole or in part at any time and from time to time prior to the expiration date. The failure by us at any time to exercise any of the above rights shall not constitute a waiver of such right, and such right shall be considered an
ongoing right which we may assert at any time and from time to time. If we determine in our reasonable judgment that any of the events listed above has
occurred, we may, subject to applicable law: 
refuse to accept any original notes and promptly return all tendered original notes to the tendering holders and
terminate any or all of the exchange offers;

extend any or all of the exchange offers and retain all original notes tendered before the expiration of the
exchange offers, subject, however, to the rights of holders to withdraw those original notes (see Withdrawal of Tenders ); or

28 

Table of Contents 

waive unsatisfied conditions relating to any or all of the exchange offers and accept all properly tendered
original notes which have not been withdrawn. If this waiver constitutes a material change to any or all of the exchange offers, we will promptly disclose the waiver in a manner reasonably calculated to inform the holders of original notes of the
waiver, and extend the offer if required by law.
Any determination by us concerning the above events will be final and binding. 
Procedures for Tendering The tender by a holder of
original notes, as set forth below, and our acceptance of the original notes will constitute a binding agreement between us and the holder in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this prospectus and in the
accompanying letter of transmittal. Unless the tender is being made in book-entry form, to tender in the exchange offers, a holder must: 

complete, sign and date the letter of transmittal, or a facsimile of it;

have the signatures guaranteed if required by the letter of transmittal; and

mail or otherwise deliver the signed letter of transmittal or the signed facsimile, the original notes and any
other required documents to the exchange agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the expiration date.
Any financial
institution that is a participant in DTCs system may make book-entry delivery of the original notes by causing DTC to transfer the original notes into the exchange agents DTC account in accordance with DTCs electronic Automated
Tender Offer Program procedures for such transfer. The confirmation of such book-entry transfer will include an agents message stating that DTC has received an express acknowledgment from the participant in DTC tendering the original notes
that the participant has received and agrees to be bound by the terms of the letter of transmittal and that we may enforce the terms of the letter of transmittal against such participant. A tender of original notes through a book-entry transfer into
the exchange agents account will only be effective if an agents message or the letter of transmittal with any required signature guarantees and any other required documents are transmitted to and received or confirmed by the exchange
agent at the address set forth below under the caption Exchange Agent , prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the expiration date. Delivery of documents to DTC in accordance with its procedures does not constitute
delivery to the exchange agent. The method of delivery of original notes and the letter of transmittal and all other required documents to the exchange
agent is at the election and risk of the holders. Instead of delivery by mail, we recommend that holders use an overnight or hand delivery service. In all cases, holders should allow sufficient time to assure delivery to the exchange agent before
the expiration date. No letter of transmittal or original notes should be sent to us. Holders may request their respective brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies or nominees to effect the tenders for such holders. 
Any beneficial owner whose original notes are registered in the name of a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee and who wishes to
tender should contact the registered holder promptly and instruct such registered holder to tender on behalf of the beneficial owner. If the beneficial owner wishes to tender on that owners own behalf, the owner must, prior to completing and
executing the letter of transmittal and delivery of such owners original notes, either make appropriate arrangements to register ownership of the original notes in the owners name or obtain a properly completed bond power from the
registered holder. The transfer of registered ownership may take considerable time.

Table of Contents 

A signature on a letter of transmittal or a notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed, unless the original
notes tendered pursuant thereto are tendered: 
by a registered holder who has not completed the box entitled Special Issuance Instructions or
Special Delivery Instructions on the letter of transmittal; or

for the account of an eligible institution (as defined below).

In the event that signatures on a letter of transmittal or a notice of withdrawal are required to be guaranteed, such guarantee must be by a financial
institution (including most banks, savings and loan associations and brokerage houses) that is a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program, the New York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature Program or the Stock Exchanges
Medallion Program (each such entity, an eligible institution ). If the letter of transmittal is signed by a person other than the
registered holder of any original notes, the original notes must be endorsed by the registered holder or accompanied by a properly completed bond power, in each case signed or endorsed in blank by the registered holder. 
If the letter of transmittal or any original notes or bond powers are signed or endorsed by trustees, executors, administrators, guardians, attorneys-in-fact,
officers of corporations or others acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such persons should so indicate when signing and, unless waived by us, submit evidence satisfactory to us of their authority to act in that capacity with the letter
of transmittal. We will determine all questions as to the validity, form, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance and withdrawal of
tendered original notes and our determination shall be final and binding on all parties. We reserve the absolute right to reject any and all original notes not properly tendered or any original notes whose acceptance by us would, in the opinion of
our counsel, be unlawful. We also reserve the right to waive any defects, irregularities or conditions of tender as to any particular original notes either before or after the expiration date. Our interpretation of the terms and conditions of the
exchange offers (including the instructions in the letter of transmittal) will be final and binding on all parties. Unless waived, any defects or
irregularities in connection with tenders of original notes must be cured within a time period we will determine. Although we intend to request the exchange agent to notify holders of defects or irregularities relating to tenders of original notes,
None of we, the exchange agent or any other person will have any duty or incur any liability for failure to give such notification. Tenders of original notes will not be considered to have been made until such defects or irregularities have been
cured or waived. Any original notes received by the exchange agent that are not properly tendered and as to which the defects or irregularities have not been cured or waived will be returned by the exchange agent to the tendering holders, unless
otherwise provided in the letter of transmittal, promptly following the expiration date. In addition, we reserve the right, as set forth above under the
caption Conditions to the Exchange Offers , to terminate any or all of the exchange offers. By tendering, each holder represents and acknowledges to us, among other things, that: 

it has full power and authority to tender, exchange, sell, assign and transfer the original notes it is tendering
and that we will acquire good, marketable and unencumbered title to the original notes, free and clear of all security interests, liens, restrictions, charges and encumbrances or other obligations relating to their sale or transfer and not subject
to any adverse claim when the original notes are accepted by us;

the exchange notes acquired in connection with the exchange offers are being obtained in the ordinary course of
business of the person receiving the exchange notes;

it has not engaged in, does not intend to engage in, and has no arrangement or understanding with any person to
participate in the distribution, as defined in the Securities Act, of the exchange notes it will receive in the exchange offers;

30 

Table of Contents 

it is not an affiliate (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Issuer or the
Guarantor; and

if the holder is a broker-dealer, that it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, a distribution of
the exchange notes, and that it will receive exchange notes for its own account in exchange for original notes that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities and that it will be required
to acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such exchange notes. See Plan of Distribution .

Withdrawal of Tenders Tenders of original notes may be
withdrawn at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the expiration date. To withdraw a tender of original notes in connection with the
exchange offers, a written notice of withdrawal must be received by the exchange agent at its address set forth herein prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the expiration date. Any such notice of withdrawal must: 

specify the name of the person who deposited the original notes to be withdrawn;

identify the original notes to be withdrawn (including the certificate number(s), if any, and principal amount of
such original notes);

be signed by the depositor in the same manner as the original signature on the letter of transmittal by which
such original notes were tendered (including any required signature guarantees) or be accompanied by documents of transfer sufficient to have the trustee register the transfer of such original notes into the name of the person withdrawing the
tender; and

specify the name in which any such original notes are to be registered, if different from that of the depositor.
If original notes have been tendered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer, any notice of withdrawal must specify the name
and number of the account at DTC to be credited with the withdrawn original notes or otherwise comply with DTCs procedures. We will determine all
questions as to the validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) of such withdrawal notices and our determination shall be final and binding on all parties. Any original notes so withdrawn will be considered not to have been validly
tendered for purposes of the exchange offers, and no exchange notes will be issued unless the original notes withdrawn are validly re-tendered. Any original notes which have been tendered but which are not accepted for exchange or which are
withdrawn will be returned to the holder without cost to such holder promptly after withdrawal, rejection of tender or termination of the exchange offers. Properly withdrawn original notes may be re-tendered by following one of the procedures
described above under Procedures for Tendering at any time prior to the expiration date. Exchange Agent 
We have appointed GBSC as exchange agent in connection with the exchange offers. Questions and requests for assistance, as well as requests for additional
copies of this prospectus or of the letter of transmittal, should be directed to the exchange agent at its office at 65 Broadway - Suite 404, New York, NY 10006, Attention: Corporate Actions. The exchange agents telephone number is (212)
430-3774 or (866) 924-2200 (toll free), its facsimile number is (212) 430-3775 and its email is contact@gbsc-usa.com. 
DELIVERY OF THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL TO AN ADDRESS OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH ABOVE OR TRANSMISSION OF SUCH LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL VIA FACSIMILE OTHER THAN AS
SET FORTH ABOVE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A VALID DELIVERY OF THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL.

Table of Contents 

Fees and Expenses 
We have not retained any dealer-manager in connection with the exchange offers and we will not make any payment to brokers, dealers or others soliciting
acceptances of the exchange offers. We will pay certain other expenses to be incurred in connection with the exchange offers, including the fees and expenses of the exchange agent and certain accountant and legal fees. 
Holders who tender their original notes for exchange will not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes. If, however, exchange notes are to be delivered to, or
issued in the name of, any person other than the registered holder of the original notes tendered; tendered original notes are registered in the name of any person other than the person signing the letter of transmittal; or a transfer tax is imposed
for any reason other than the exchange of original notes in connection with the exchange offers, then the tendering holder must pay the amount of any transfer taxes due, whether imposed on the registered holder or any other persons. If the tendering
holder does not submit satisfactory evidence of payment of these taxes or exemption from them with the letter of transmittal, the amount of these transfer taxes will be billed directly to the tendering holder. 
Accounting Treatment The exchange notes will be recorded
at the same carrying value as the original notes as reflected in our accounting records on the date of the exchange. Accordingly, we will not recognize any gain or loss for accounting purposes related to the exchange offers. We will record the
expenses of the exchange offers as incurred. Consequences of Failure to Properly Tender Original Notes in the Exchange Offers 
Issuance of the exchange notes in exchange for the original notes under the exchange offers will be made only after timely receipt by the exchange agent of a
properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal (or an agents message from DTC) and the certificate(s) representing such original notes (or confirmation of book-entry transfer), and all other required documents. Therefore, holders
of the original notes desiring to tender such original notes in exchange for exchange notes should allow sufficient time to ensure timely delivery. All
questions as to the form of documents and validity, eligibility (including time of receipt), acceptance for exchange and withdrawal of tendered original notes will be determined by the Company in its sole discretion, and its determination will be
final and binding. The Company reserves the absolute right to reject any and all tenders of notes that it determines are not in proper form or for which the acceptance for exchange or exchange may, in the opinion of its counsel, be unlawful. The
Company also reserves the right to waive any of the conditions of the exchange offers or any defect or irregularity in the tender of original notes of any particular holder, whether or not similar conditions, defects or irregularities are waived in
the case of other holders of original notes. The Companys interpretation of the terms and conditions of the exchange offers (including the instructions in the Letter of Transmittal) will be final and binding. No tender or notice of withdrawal
will be deemed to have been validly made until all defects or irregularities have been cured or waived by the Company. We are under no duty to give notification of defects or irregularities of tenders of original notes for exchange or waive any such
defects or irregularities. Original notes that are not tendered or that are tendered but not
accepted by us will, following completion of the exchange offers, continue to be subject to the existing restrictions upon transfer thereof under the Securities Act, and, upon completion of the exchange offers, certain registration rights under the
registration rights agreement will terminate. In the event the exchange offers are completed, the Issuer generally will not be required to register the
remaining original notes, subject to limited exceptions. Remaining original notes will continue to be subject to the following restrictions on transfer: 
the remaining original notes may be resold only if registered pursuant to the Securities Act, if any exemption
from registration is available, or if such registration is not required by law; and

32 

Table of Contents 

the remaining original notes will bear a legend restricting transfer in the absence of registration or an
exemption.
We do not currently anticipate that we will register the remaining original notes under the Securities Act. To the extent
that original notes are tendered and accepted in connection with the exchange offers, any trading market for remaining original notes could be adversely affected. See Risk FactorsRisks Relating to the Exchange OffersIf you fail
to exchange your original notes, they will continue to be restricted securities and may become less liquid . Neither we nor our board of
directors make any recommendation to holders of original notes as to whether to tender or refrain from tendering all or any portion of their original notes pursuant to the exchange offers. Moreover, no one has been authorized to make any such
recommendation. Holders of original notes must make their own decision whether to tender pursuant to the exchange offers and, if so, the aggregate amount of original notes to tender, after reading this prospectus and the letter of transmittal and
consulting with their advisors, if any, based on their own financial position and requirements.

DESCRIPTION OF NOTES 
In this Description of Notes , references to the Company , we , us or
our refer to The Walt Disney Company. References in this Description of Notes to the Guarantor are to TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp. Capitalized terms used in this description but not otherwise
defined herein or in this prospectus have the meanings assigned to them in the indenture (as defined below). The original notes were issued by The Walt
Disney Company ( Disney ), under the indenture dated as of March 20, 2019 (the indenture ), among Disney, as issuer, TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp., as guarantor, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the
Trustee ), in connection with the prior private exchange offers described elsewhere in this prospectus. The exchange notes will also be issued under such indenture. 
Any original notes of a series that remain outstanding after completion of each of the exchange offers, together with the exchange notes of such series issued
in the exchange offers, will be treated as a single class of securities under the indenture. The terms of the exchange notes are substantially identical to the terms of the corresponding series of the original notes, except that the exchange notes
are registered under the Securities Act, and the transfer restrictions, registration rights and payment of additional interest in case of non-registration applicable to the original notes do not apply to the
exchange notes. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the notes in this Description of Notes include
the original notes issued in the prior private exchange offers and the exchange notes offered hereby which have been registered under the Securities Act. 
The terms of the notes will include those stated in the indenture and those made part of the indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended (the Trust Indenture Act ). The following description of certain provisions of the notes and the indenture is not complete and
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture and the forms of the notes. You should review the indenture and the forms of the notes, copies of which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement to which this prospectus
relates. General Each series of notes constitutes a
separate series of Disneys senior debt securities under the indenture, initially limited in aggregate principal amount as set forth below, but subject to Disneys right from time to time, without the consent of the holders of any series
of notes, to issue additional notes of any such series as described below under Further Issues . There is no limit under the indenture on the aggregate principal amount of any series of notes that Disney may issue. 
With respect to each series of exchange notes set forth below, (a) interest will accrue on such exchange notes from the most recent date to which
interest on the respective original notes has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the issue date of the respective original notes and (b) if the regular record date for the first interest payment date would be a date prior to the
settlement date of the related exchange offer, the record date for such first interest payment date will be the day immediately preceding such first interest payment date. 
The notes will be issued in fully-registered, book-entry form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The notes
will be held in global form by DTC, as depositary, and will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.

option of the holders of the applicable notes, upon acceleration or otherwise. If for any reason Disney does not make any required payment in respect of the notes of any series when due, the Guarantor will on demand pay the unpaid amount at the same
place and in the same manner that applies to payments made by Disney under the indenture. The guarantee is of payment, performance and compliance and not of collection.

indebtedness for borrowed money of Disney and its Measured Subsidiaries (other than any indebtedness for borrowed money represented by guarantees of third-party indebtedness), on a consolidated basis, as of such time, (ii) upon the sale,
transfer or disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all or substantially all of the equity interests or assets of the Guarantor to another person (other than to Disney or any of its subsidiaries), (iii) upon the discharge
of Disneys obligations under the indenture in accordance with its terms or (iv) upon any covenant defeasance or legal defeasance with respect to the notes of the applicable series as described in Discharge and

or indirectly (through one or more Measured Subsidiaries) owned by such person. In the case of a Non-Corporate Entity, a person shall be deemed to have more than 50% of interests having ordinary voting power
only if such persons vote in respect of such interests comprises more than 50% of the total voting power of all such interests in such Non-Corporate Entity. For purposes of this definition, any
managerial powers or rights comparable to managerial powers afforded to a person solely by reason of such persons ownership of general partner or comparable interests (or foreign equivalent) shall not be deemed to be interests having
ordinary voting power. Shanghai Project Entity means any subsidiary of the Guarantor and any other person whose equity
securities or interests are owned, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, the primary business of which is the direct or indirect ownership, management, operation, design, construction and/or

affiliate or other person); and (iii) the property over which liens are granted to secure such Project Debt, if any, consists solely of
the assets and revenues of such particular project or the equity securities or interests of such affiliate or other person or a subsidiary of the Guarantor referred to in clause (c) below; and 
(c) each affiliate of the Guarantor organized after the Organization Date (or whose business commenced after the Organization Date) whose
equity securities or interests are owned, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, the primary business of which is the direct or indirect ownership, management or operation of, or provision of

Consequences of Holding Company Status 
Operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our cash flow and our ability to service our debt, including the notes, are
dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to us, whether by dividends, loans or otherwise. The payment of dividends and the making of loans and advances to us by our subsidiaries may be subject to
statutory or contractual restrictions, are contingent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and are subject to various business considerations. Our right to receive assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization (and the
consequent right of the holders of the notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiarys creditors (including trade creditors), except to the extent that we are recognized as a creditor of
that subsidiary, in which case our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of the subsidiary and would still be contractually subordinated to any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by
us. Holders of the notes have a direct claim only against us and the Guarantor. See Risk FactorsThe Walt Disney Company is a holding
company, and the notes will be structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries, other than the Guarantor. The guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of the
Guarantors subsidiaries. Ranking 
The notes will be Disneys senior unsecured indebtedness and will rank pari passu with each other and with all of Disneys other unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. However, the notes will be structurally subordinated to any indebtedness and preferred stock, if any, of Disneys subsidiaries (other than the Guarantor, which is a subsidiary guarantor
of the notes, subject to certain releases described under the caption The Guarantee ), and will be effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.
Claims of the creditors and preferred stockholders of Disneys subsidiaries other than the Guarantor will generally have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such subsidiaries over the claims of Disneys creditors, including
holders of the notes. Accordingly, the notes will be structurally subordinated to creditors, including trade creditors and preferred stockholders, if any, of Disneys subsidiaries (other than the Guarantor, which is a subsidiary guarantor of
the notes, subject to certain releases described under the caption The Guarantee ). The Guarantor will fully and unconditionally
guarantee the full and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, interest on, and all other amounts payable under the notes when the same becomes due and payable. The guarantee will be the Guarantors senior unsecured obligation
and will rank pari passu with all of the Guarantors other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding and will be effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such indebtedness. The indenture does not restrict the ability of Disneys subsidiaries to incur indebtedness. For additional information,
see Risk FactorsThe Walt Disney Company is a holding company, and the notes will be structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries, other than the Guarantor. The guarantee will be structurally
subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of the Guarantors subsidiaries. Further Issues 
Disney may, from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the registered holders of any series of notes, issue additional notes ranking pari
passu with, and with the same terms and provisions as, such series of notes offered hereby (except for the date of original issuance, and, if applicable, the date from which interest will accrue, the first interest payment date, the offering and
sale prices thereof and restrictions on transfer) ( Additional Notes ). Any such Additional Notes, together with the applicable series of notes, will constitute a single series of Disneys senior debt securities under the
indenture.

(expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date. On and after the redemption date,
interest will cease to accrue on such Disney Redeemable Notes or any portion of such Disney Redeemable Notes called for redemption (unless Disney defaults in the payment of the redemption 
51

price and accrued interest). On or before the redemption date, Disney will deposit with a paying agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the
Disney Redeemable Notes to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the Disney Redeemable Notes are to be redeemed, the Disney Redeemable Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by a method the Trustee deems to be fair and
appropriate. Open Market Purchases Disney or its
affiliates may acquire the notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws. 
Certain Covenants Covenants Generally 
The indenture does not include covenants limiting the amount of secured or unsecured indebtedness that may be incurred by Disney, the Guarantor and
Disneys subsidiaries or otherwise restricting Disneys or the Guarantors ability to enter into a highly leveraged transaction, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction involving Disney or the
Guarantor that may adversely affect the holders of the notes, if, in the case of a consolidation, merger or transfer or lease of Disneys or the Guarantors assets substantially as an entirety, the applicable transaction complies with the
provisions described below under Mergers and Sales of Assets . In addition, the indenture does not afford the holders of the notes the right to require Disney to repurchase or redeem the notes in the event of a highly
leveraged transaction. See Mergers and Sales of Assets . Reports 
Disney shall file with the Trustee, within 15 days after it files such annual and quarterly reports, information, documents and other reports with the SEC,
copies of its annual report and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) which Disney is required to file with the SEC pursuant to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; provided , however , that Disney shall be deemed to have filed any such information, document or report with the Trustee if Disney has timely filed it with the SEC via the EDGAR filing system
(or any successor system). Disney also shall comply with the other provisions of the Trust Indenture Act Section 314(a). Mergers and Sales of
Assets Disney The indenture provides that
Disney may not consolidate with or merge with or into any other person or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to another person, unless, among other things, (i) Disney is the continuing corporation,
or the resulting, surviving or transferee person (if other than Disney) is organized and existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that person expressly assumes all of Disneys obligations
under the notes and the indenture, (ii) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no event which is, or after notice or passage of time or both would be, an event of default under the indenture (any such event, a
default ) shall have occurred and be continuing under the indenture and (iii) Disney delivers to the Trustee an officers certificate and an opinion of counsel to the effect that the consolidation, merger, conveyance,
transfer or lease, as the case may be, complies with the indenture and that all conditions precedent provided in the indenture with respect to the transaction have been satisfied. Any such successor person formed by any such consolidation or into
which Disney is merged or to which any such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, Disney under the indenture and Disney will be discharged from all obligations under the indenture and the debt securities
issued thereunder, except in the case of a lease of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety. 
52 

Table of Contents 

The Guarantor 
Subject to the guarantee release provisions therein, the indenture provides that the Guarantor may not consolidate with or merge with or into any other person
or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to another person, unless, among other things, (i) it is the continuing person, it is merged or consolidated into us or another guarantor under the indenture or
the resulting, surviving or transferee person (if other than Disney or the Guarantor) is organized and existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that person expressly assumes all of the
Guarantors obligations under the notes and the indenture and (ii) Disney delivers to the Trustee an officers certificate and an opinion of counsel to the effect that the consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease, as the
case may be, complies with the indenture and that all conditions precedent provided in the indenture with respect to the transaction have been satisfied. Any such successor person formed by any such consolidation or into which the Guarantor is
merged or to which any such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, the Guarantor under the indenture and the Guarantor will be discharged from all obligations under the indenture and the debt securities
issued thereunder, except in the case of a lease of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety. Events of Default 
The indenture provides that if an event of default (other than an event of default described in clause (d) of the next paragraph) occurs and is continuing
with respect to a series of notes, the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of that series may declare the principal amount of the notes of that series to be immediately due and payable.
If an event of default described in clause (d) of the next paragraph occurs and is continuing with respect to a series of notes, the principal amount of the notes of that series shall become and be immediately due and payable, without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or the holders of any notes of that series. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of the series may rescind an acceleration
of the notes of such series and its consequences. The following events will constitute an event of default with respect to each series of notes: 

(a) default in payment of any principal of or premium, if any, on any Note of the series when due;

(b) default in payment of any interest on any Note of the series when due, continuing for 30 days;

(c) failure by Disney to comply with its other agreements in the notes of the series or the indenture for the
benefit of the holders of the notes of that series upon the receipt by Disney of notice of the default given by the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of the series and Disneys failure
to cure the default within 60 days after receipt by Disney of the notice;

(d) specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to Disney or the Guarantor; and

(e) the guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect (other than as specified above under The
Guarantee ) or the Guarantor denies its liability under the guarantee.
The Trustee will give notice to holders of the notes of
any continuing default known to the Trustee within 90 days after the occurrence of the default. However, the Trustee may withhold notice of any default, other than a payment default, if it determines in good faith that withholding the notice is
in the interests of the holders. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of any series may direct the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the notes of that series, provided that the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that
conflicts with any law or the indenture or that the Trustee determines in good faith is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other holders or would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Before proceeding to exercise any right or power under the
indenture at the direction of holders, the Trustee will be entitled to receive 
53 

Table of Contents 

from the holders reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in complying with the direction. With respect to each series of notes,
no holder will have any right to pursue any remedy with respect to the indenture or the notes of that series, unless: 
(a) the holder has previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing event of default with respect to the
notes of that series;

(b) the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of the series have made a
written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(c) the holder or holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee;

(d) the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of the series have not given
the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request; and

(e) the Trustee has failed to comply with the request within the 60-day period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right of any holder of any note to receive payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest in respect of such note on the date or dates specified for payment in the note (or, in the case of redemption, on the applicable redemption date), or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates,
shall not be impaired or adversely affected without the holders consent. The holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of any series may waive an existing default with respect to that series and its
consequences, other than (i) an event of default in the payment of any principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any note of the series when due, or (ii) a default in respect of the covenants or provisions in the indenture which
may not be modified without the consent of the holder of each outstanding note of the series affected as described in Modification and Waiver below. 
The indenture provides for Disney to deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each of Disneys fiscal years an officers certificate
stating whether or not the signer knows of any default that occurred during the last fiscal year. Modification and Waiver 
The indenture permits Disney, the Guarantor and the Trustee to execute a supplemental indenture without the consent of the holders of the notes: 

to evidence the succession of another organization to Disney and the assumption by it of Disneys
obligations under the indenture and the notes;

to evidence the succession of another organization to the Guarantor and the assumption by it of the
Guarantors obligations under the indenture;

to add to Disneys or the Guarantors covenants, agreements and obligations for the benefit of the
holders of all the notes or any series thereof, or to surrender any right or power conferred in the indenture upon Disney;

to establish the form or terms of additional debt securities of any series as permitted by the indenture;

to provide for the acceptance of appointment under the indenture of a successor trustee with respect to the notes
of one or more series and to add to or change any provisions of the indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts by more than one trustee;

to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

to add to, change or eliminate any provisions (which addition, change or elimination may apply to one or more
series of debt securities); provided that the addition, change or elimination neither (a) applies

54 

Table of Contents 

to any debt security of any series that was created prior to the execution of the supplemental indenture (including the notes) and is entitled to the benefit of that provision nor
(b) modifies the rights of the holder of any such debt security with respect to that provision;

to change or eliminate any provisions as is necessary or desirable in accordance with any amendments to the Trust
Indenture Act;

to reflect the release of the Guarantor in accordance with the provisions described in The
Guarantee above;

to add guarantors with respect to the notes or to secure the notes (and to reflect the release of any such
additional guarantees or security in accordance with the terms of the indenture); or

to make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder of the notes in any material
respect.
The indenture also permits Disney, the Guarantor and the Trustee, with the consent of (i) the holders of not less than a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities voting as a single class or (ii) in case less than all of the series of outstanding debt securities are affected by such addition, change, elimination or modification, the holders
of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding securities of all series so affected by such supplemental indenture voting as a single class (including, for the avoidance of doubt, consents obtained in connection with a purchase
of, or tender offer or exchange for, the debt securities), to execute a supplemental indenture to add provisions to, or change in any manner or eliminate any provisions of, the indenture with respect to the applicable series of debt securities or
modify in any manner the rights of the holders of the debt securities of applicable series under the indenture, and the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series under the indenture
may, by written consent, waive compliance by Disney or the Guarantor with any provision of the indenture (but solely insofar as such provision relates to the debt securities of such series) or any provision of the debt securities of such series;
provided , however , that no such supplemental indenture or waiver shall, without the written consent of the holder of each outstanding debt security under the indenture (including the holder of each outstanding note) affected thereby:

change the stated maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal or interest on, any such debt
security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon or any premium payable upon redemption thereof;

reduce the amount of principal of any original issue discount security that would be due and payable upon
declaration of acceleration of maturity thereof;

change the place or currency of payment of principal and premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any such debt
security;

impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on any such debt security on or after
the stated maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date);

reduce the percentage in principal amount of outstanding debt securities of any series necessary to modify or
amend the indenture or to waive compliance with certain provisions thereof or certain defaults thereunder with respect to the debt securities of such series; or

modify any of the provisions of the indenture described in this paragraph except to increase the percentage of
outstanding debt securities of such series required for such actions or to provide that certain other provisions of the indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the holder of each outstanding debt security affected thereby.
Discharge and Defeasance The
indenture provides that Disney may satisfy and discharge its obligations thereunder (subject to limited exceptions) with respect to the notes of any series by delivering to the Trustee for cancellation all outstanding

55 

Table of Contents 

notes of the series or depositing with the Trustee, after the outstanding notes of such series have become due and payable, or will become due and payable within one year or will be called for
redemption within one year, cash sufficient to pay to the date of deposit (in the case of notes of such series which have become due and payable) or to the stated maturity or redemption date, as the case may be, all of the outstanding notes of the
series and all other sums payable under the indenture with respect to the series. The indenture provides that Disney may: 

(a) be discharged from its obligations (subject to exceptions) in respect of the notes of a series
( defeasance and discharge ), or

(b) cease to comply with specified covenants insofar as they relate to the notes of a series ( covenant
defeasance ), including those described under Certain CovenantsMergers and Sales of Assets ;
and
the omission will not be an event of default with respect to the notes of that series, in each case at any time prior to the stated maturity or redemption thereof, if Disney irrevocably deposits with the Trustee, in trust: 

(i) sufficient funds in the currency or currency unit in which the notes of that series are denominated to pay the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest to stated maturity or redemption on, the notes of that series, or

(ii) that amount of direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are fully
guaranteed by, the government which issued the currency in which the notes are denominated, and which are not subject to prepayment, redemption or call, as will, together with the predetermined and certain income to accrue thereon without
consideration of any reinvestment thereof, be sufficient to pay when due the principal of, premium, if any, and interest to stated maturity or redemption on, the debt securities of that series.

The defeasance and discharge and covenant defeasance described above are effective only if, among other things, Disney delivers an opinion of counsel to the
effect that (i) Disney has met all of the conditions precedent to the defeasance and the holders of the notes of the series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the defeasance, and will be
subject to tax in the same manner as if no defeasance had occurred and (ii) in the case of defeasance and discharge, the opinion as to tax consequences is based upon an Internal Revenue Service ruling or a change in applicable U.S. federal
income tax law; provided , however , that the opinion of counsel required by clause (i) above will not need to be delivered if all notes of the applicable series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become
due and payable or will become due and payable at the maturity date of such notes within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in Disneys name and at its
expense. Upon the defeasance and discharge, the holders of the notes of the series will no longer be entitled to the benefits of the indenture, subject
to certain exceptions (including for the purposes of registration of transfer and exchange of the notes of the series and replacement of lost, stolen or mutilated notes), and should look to the deposited funds or obligations for payment. In the case
of covenant defeasance of the notes of any series, Disney and any guarantors will no longer be required to comply, solely insofar as relates to the notes of that series, with the covenants as to which covenant defeasance has occurred and a failure
to comply with those covenants shall thereafter not constitute a default or event of default with respect of the notes of that series. The Trustee
under the Indenture Citibank, N.A., is the trustee with respect to the notes and maintains various commercial and investment banking relationships
with Disney and its affiliates. Citibank, N.A. will be permitted to engage in other transactions with Disney and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates. However, if Citibank, N.A. acquires any conflicting interest, as defined in the Trust Indenture Act,
it must eliminate the conflict or resign. 
56 

Table of Contents 

Citibank, N.A. will initially act as paying agent, transfer agent, authenticating agent and security
registrar for the notes, acting through its corporate trust office currently located at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10013. Except during the
continuance of an event of default, Citibank, N.A. need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in the indenture and no others. In case an event of default occurs and is continuing, Citibank, N.A. is required to exercise the rights
and powers vested in it by the indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in the conduct of its own affairs. 
Governing Law The indenture, including the guarantee
provided by the Guarantor, and the notes are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. 
57 

Table of Contents 

BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM 
The Global Notes Initially, the exchange notes will be
represented by one or more registered notes in global form, without interest coupons (collectively, the Global Notes ). The Global Notes will be deposited on the issue date with, or on behalf of, DTC and registered in the name of
Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC, or will remain with the trustee as custodian for DTC. Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be
transferred, in whole and not in part, solely to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes may not be exchanged for notes in physical, certificated form ( Certificated
Notes ) except in the limited circumstances described below. All interests in the Global Notes, including those held through Euroclear or
Clearstream, Luxembourg, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. 
Certain Book-Entry Procedures for the Global Notes The
descriptions of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg set forth below are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement
systems and are subject to change by them from time to time. We do not take any responsibility for these operations or procedures, and investors are urged to contact the relevant system or its participants directly to discuss these matters. 
DTC has advised us that it is: 
a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York;

a banking organization within the meaning of the New York Banking Law;

a member of the Federal Reserve System;

a clearing corporation within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code, as amended; and

a clearing agency registered pursuant to Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants (collectively, the Participants ) and facilitates the clearance and settlement of
securities transactions between Participants through electronic book-entry changes to the accounts of its Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical transfer and delivery of certificates. DTCs Participants include securities
brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Indirect access to DTCs system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies (collectively, the
Indirect Participants ) that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly. Investors who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only
through Participants or Indirect Participants. We expect that pursuant to procedures established by DTC (1) upon deposit of each Global Note, DTC
will credit the accounts of Participants with an interest in the Global Note and (2) ownership of the exchange notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect
to the interests of Participants) and the records of Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to the interests of persons other than Participants). 
The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Accordingly,
the ability to transfer interests in the exchange notes represented by a 
58 

Table of Contents 

Global Note to such persons may be limited. In addition, because DTC can act only on behalf of its Participants, who in turn act on behalf of persons who hold interests through Participants, the
ability of a person having an interest in exchange notes represented by a Global Note to pledge or transfer such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in DTCs system, or to otherwise take actions in respect of such interest,
may be affected by the lack of a physical definitive security in respect of such interest. So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner of a
Global Note, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the exchange notes represented by the Global Notes for all purposes under the indenture. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in
a Global Note will not be entitled to have exchange notes represented by such Global Note registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of Certificated Notes, and will not be considered the owners or holders
thereof under the indenture for any purpose, including with respect to the giving of any direction, instruction or approval to the trustee thereunder. Accordingly, each holder owning a beneficial interest in a Global Note must rely on the procedures
of DTC and, if such holder is not a Participant or an Indirect Participant, on the procedures of the Participant through which such holder owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a holder of exchange notes under the indenture or such Global
Notes. We understand that under existing industry practice, in the event that we request any action of holders of exchange notes, or a holder that is an owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note desires to take any action that DTC, as the
holder of such Global Note, is entitled to take, DTC would authorize the Participants to take such action and the Participants would authorize holders owning through such Participants to take such action or would otherwise act upon the instruction
of such holders. Neither we nor the trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of exchange notes by DTC, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of DTC
relating to such exchange notes. Payments with respect to the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, any exchange notes represented by a
Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee on the applicable record date will be payable by the trustee to or at the direction of DTC or its nominee in its capacity as the registered holder of the Global Notes representing such notes
under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, we and the trustee may treat the persons in whose names the notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payment thereon and for any and
all other purposes whatsoever. Accordingly, neither we nor the trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for the payment of such amounts to owners of beneficial interests in a Global Note (including principal, premium, if any, and
interest). Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the owners of beneficial interests in a Global Note will be governed by standing instructions and customary industry practice and will be the responsibility of the Participants
or the Indirect Participants and DTC. Transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTCs procedures, and will be
settled in same-day funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. 
Cross-market transfers between the Participants in DTC, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg participants, on the other hand, will be
effected through DTC in accordance with DTCs rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, by its respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear
or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, by the counterparts in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may
be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Notes in DTC, and
making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream, Luxembourg participants may not deliver instructions
directly to the depositaries for Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg.

Table of Contents 

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg
participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg participant, during the securities settlement processing day
(which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as a result of sales of interests in the Global Notes by or through a
Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg participant to a Participant in DTC will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg cash account only as of the business day
for Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg following DTCs settlement date. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg have agreed to the
foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures
may be discontinued at any time. Neither we nor the trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under
the rules and procedures governing their operations. Certificated Notes 
If: 
DTCs book-entry only system ceases to exist;

we determine that DTC is no longer willing or able to discharge properly its responsibilities as depository with
respect to the notes and we are unable to locate a qualified successor;

we, at our option, elect to terminate the record book-entry system through DTC with respect to all or a portion
of such series of notes;

required by law; or

an event of default with respect to the notes has occurred and is continuing

then, upon surrender by DTC of the Global Notes, Certificated Notes will be issued to each person that DTC identifies as the beneficial owner of the notes
represented by the Global Notes. Upon any such issuance, the trustee is required to register such Certificated Notes in the name of such person or persons (or the nominee of any thereof) and cause the same to be delivered thereto. 
Neither we nor the trustee shall be liable for any delay by DTC or any Participant or Indirect Participant in identifying the beneficial owners of the related
notes and each such person may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, instructions from DTC for all purposes (including with respect to the registration and delivery, and the respective principal amounts, of the exchange notes
to be issued).

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offers to holders of original notes, but is not a
complete analysis of all potential tax effects. The summary below is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), regulations of the Treasury Department, administrative rulings and pronouncements of the
Internal Revenue Service and judicial decisions, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, or to differing interpretations. This summary does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be
applicable to particular holders, including dealers in securities, financial institutions, insurance companies and tax-exempt organizations. In addition, this summary does not consider the effect of any
foreign, state, local, gift, estate or other tax laws that may be applicable to a particular holder. This summary applies only to a holder that acquired original notes at original issue for cash and holds such original notes as capital
assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. An exchange of original notes for exchange notes pursuant to the exchange offers will
not be treated as a taxable exchange or other taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, there will be no U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders who exchange their original notes for exchange notes in connection with
the exchange offers and any such holder will have the same adjusted tax basis and holding period in the exchange notes as it had in the original notes immediately before the exchange. Holders who do not exchange their original notes for exchange
notes pursuant to the exchange offers will not recognize any gain or loss, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, upon consummation of the exchange offers. 
The foregoing discussion of material U.S. federal income tax consequences does not consider the facts and circumstances of any particular holders
situation or status. Accordingly, each holder of original notes considering the exchange offers should consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the exchange offers to it, including those under state, foreign and other tax laws.

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION 
Each broker-dealer that receives exchange notes for its own account pursuant to an exchange offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in
connection with any resale of such exchange notes. This prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of exchange notes received in exchange for original notes where
such original notes were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. The Issuer has agreed that it will furnish to each broker-dealer who has delivered the notice to the Issuer required by and in accordance with the
registration rights agreement, without charge, as many copies of the prospectus and any amendment and supplement thereto, as such participating broker-dealer may reasonably request in connection with its resale of its exchange notes. 
The Issuer will not receive any proceeds from any sale of exchange notes by broker-dealers. Exchange notes received by broker-dealers for their own account
pursuant to the exchange offers may be sold from time to time in one or more transactions in the over-the-counter market, in negotiated transactions, through the writing
of options on the exchange notes or a combination of such methods of resale, at market prices prevailing at the time of resale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. Any such resale may be made directly to
purchasers or to or through brokers or dealers who may receive compensation in the form of commissions or concessions from any such broker-dealer and/or the purchasers of any such exchange notes. Any broker-dealer that resells exchange notes that
were received by it for its own account pursuant to the exchange offers and any broker or dealer that participates in a distribution of such exchange notes may be deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, and
any profit of any such resale of exchange notes and any commissions or concessions received by any such persons may be deemed to be underwriting compensation under the Securities Act. The letter of transmittal states that, by acknowledging that it
will deliver, and by delivering, a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act. 
Subject to the terms of the registration rights agreement, the Issuer will promptly send additional copies of this prospectus and any amendment or supplement
to this prospectus to any broker-dealer that requests such documents. The Issuer has agreed to pay all expenses incident to the exchange offers (including the expenses of one counsel for the holders of the notes) other than commissions or
concessions of any brokers or dealers and transfer taxes, and will indemnify the holders of the notes (including any broker-dealers) against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. 
Selling Restrictions Notice to Canadian Investors
The notes may be sold in Canada only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are accredited investors, as defined in
National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument
31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the notes must be made in accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus
requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws. Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with
remedies for rescission or damages if this prospectus (including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the
securities legislation of the purchasers province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchasers province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with
a legal advisor. By acquiring exchange notes, each holder (if it resides in Canada) will be deemed to represent, warrant and agree that, unless permitted
under applicable securities legislation, it must not offer, sell, pledge, trade or otherwise

Regulation ) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the
EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom

PART II 
INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS 
Item 20. Indemnification of Directors and Officers 
Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL ) empowers a Delaware corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a party
or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that
such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such corporation or is or was serving at the request of such corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise. The indemnity may include expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, provided that such
person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such
persons conduct was unlawful. A Delaware corporation may indemnify directors, officers, employees and other agents of such corporation in an action by or in the right of the corporation under the same conditions, except that no indemnification
is permitted without judicial approval if the person to be indemnified has been adjudged to be liable to the corporation. Where a present or former director or officer of the corporation is successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of any
action, suit or proceeding referred to above or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, a Delaware corporation must indemnify such person against the expenses (including attorneys fees) which he or she actually and reasonably
incurred in connection therewith. The Walt Disney Company 
The Walt Disney Companys certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated, and bylaws, as amended and restated, contain provisions that provide for
indemnification of officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by, and in the manner permissible under, applicable state and federal law, including the DGCL. 
As permitted by Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, The Walt Disney Companys certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated, contains a provision
eliminating the personal liability of a director to The Walt Disney Company or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, subject to certain exceptions. 
The Walt Disney Company maintains policies insuring its officers and directors against certain civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities
Act. The Walt Disney Company has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its directors and certain of its officers and anticipates that it
will enter into similar agreements with future officers and directors. Generally, these agreements attempt to provide the maximum protection permitted by Delaware law with respect to indemnification. The indemnification agreements provide that The
Walt Disney Company will pay certain amounts incurred by its directors in connection with any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action or proceeding. Such amounts include any expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, civil
or criminal fines, settlement amounts and other expenses customarily incurred in connection with legal proceedings. The foregoing summaries are
necessarily subject to the complete text of the statute, The Walt Disney Companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, the indemnification agreements and the arrangements referred to above and are
qualified in their entirety by reference thereto. TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp. 
The TWDC Enterprises certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated, and bylaws, as amended and restated, contain provisions that provide for
indemnification of officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by, and in the manner permissible under, applicable state and federal law, including the DGCL.

maximum protection permitted by Delaware law with respect to indemnification. The indemnification agreements provide that TWDC Enterprises will pay certain amounts incurred by its officers and directors in connection with any civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative action or proceeding. Such amounts include any expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, civil or criminal fines, settlement amounts and other expenses customarily incurred in connection with legal
proceedings. The foregoing summaries are necessarily subject to the complete text of the statute, TWDC Enterprises amended and restated certificate
of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the indemnification agreements and the arrangements referred to above, and are qualified in their entirety by reference thereto. The amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended
and restated bylaws of TWDC Enterprises are filed as exhibits to TWDC Enterprisess Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 20, 2019, which is incorporated by reference herein.

Item 22. Undertakings (a) Each of the undersigned
registrants hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this
registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act; 
(ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent
post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities
offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the SEC
pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective
registration statement; and (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in
the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement. (2) That, for purposes of determining
any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the
initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being
registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. (4) That, for purposes of determining liability under the Securities
Act to any purchaser: (i) Each prospectus filed by the registrants pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the
registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and (ii) Each
prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in 
II-3 

Table of Contents 

reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided , however , that no
statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration
statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such
document immediately prior to such date of first use. (5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrants under the
Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of securities: The undersigned registrants undertake that, in a primary
offering of securities of the undersigned registrants pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of
any of the following communications, the undersigned registrants will be sellers to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: 
(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrants relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424
under the Securities Act; (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned
registrants or used or referred to by the undersigned registrants; (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the
offering containing material information about the undersigned registrants or their securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrants; and 
(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrants to the purchaser. 
(6) That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the registrants annual report pursuant to
section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plans annual report pursuant to section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement
shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. 
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrants
pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, such registrants have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event
that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrants of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrants in the successful defense of any action, suit or
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrants will, unless in the opinion of their counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to
a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by them is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 
(b) Each of the undersigned registrants hereby undertakes to respond to requests for information that is incorporated by reference into the prospectus
pursuant to Items 4, 10(b), 11 or 13 of this Form, within one business day of receipt of such request, and to send the incorporated documents by first-class mail or other equally prompt means. This includes information contained in documents filed
subsequent to the effective date of the registration statement through the date of responding to the request. (c) Each of the undersigned registrants
hereby undertakes to supply by means of a post-effective amendment all information concerning a transaction, and the company being acquired involved therein, that was not the subject of and included in the registration statement when it became
effective.

The Walt Disney Company, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein referred to as the
Company ), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of [] dollars ($[]) on [], [] (the Maturity Date ) and to pay
interest thereon from [], 2019 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date (as defined below) to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually in arrears in equal installments on [] and [] of each year
(each, an Interest Payment Date ), commencing on [], [], at the rate of []% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest payments on this Note will include interest
accrued to but excluding the Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date, as the case may be. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture (as defined on the other side
of this Note), be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the preceding [] or [] (each, a Regular Record Date ), as the case may be
(whether or not any such Regular Record Date is a Business Day (as defined on the other side of this Note)), next preceding such Interest Payment Date, provided , that, if the Regular Record Date for the first Interest Payment Date would be a
date prior to [], 2019, the Regular Record Date for such first Interest Payment Date will be the day immediately preceding such first Interest Payment Date (whether or not such day is a Business Day). If any Interest Payment Date, any
Redemption Date, the Maturity Date or any other date on which a payment on the Notes is due is not a Business Day, the payment due on such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Maturity Date or other date, as applicable, will be made on the next
succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Maturity Date or other date, as applicable, and no additional interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and
after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Maturity Date or other date, as the case may be, to such next succeeding Business Day. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months. Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any interest
not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein called Defaulted Interest ) will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the Regular Record Date with respect to such Interest Payment Date and
may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee (as defined on the
other side of this Note), notice of which shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange
on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. 
All payments of principal of, premium (if any), and interest on, the Notes will be payable in the coin or currency of the United States of
America. New York, New York is a Place of Payment for the Notes. The Company will maintain a Paying Agent, Registrar or co-Registrar, transfer agent and authenticating agent for the Notes in such Place of Payment, and Citibank, N.A. (the Paying Agent ) has been appointed by the Company as the initial Paying Agent,
Registrar, transfer agent and authenticating agent for the Notes in such Place of Payment. Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in New York, New York,
initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office (as defined on the other side of this Note) of the Paying Agent currently located at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10013, and solely for the purpose of the transfer, surrender, exchange or
presentation of Notes for final payment, located at 480 Washington Boulevard, 30th Floor, Jersey City, New Jersey 07310, Attention: Securities Window The Walt Disney Company, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may
designate; provided , however , that at the option of the Company, payments of interest on this Note (other than on the Maturity Date) may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such

address shall appear in the register of Notes or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Holder of this Note if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been
received in writing by the Paying Agent not less than 15 days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date; and provided , further , that if this Note is a global note (a Global Note ) registered in the name of a
Depositary or its nominee, payments of principal of and interest on this Note shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Depositary or its nominee. Any wire transfer instructions received by a Paying Agent shall remain in
effect until revoked by the applicable registered Holder. Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on
the other side of this Note, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place. Unless
the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or its duly appointed authenticating agent by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

[]% Notes due [] 
This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Company (which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture
hereinafter referred to) issued and to be issued pursuant to such Indenture and designated by the Company as its []% Notes due [] (the Notes ). The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of the
Securities which may be issued thereunder. The Company issued this Note pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 20, 2019 (herein
called the Indenture ), among the Company, TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp., a Delaware Corporation, as guarantor, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (herein called the Trustee , which term includes any successor trustee
under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, each Guarantor, the Trustee
and Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Notes are in
registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 principal amount and integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like
aggregate principal amount of Notes of any authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same, upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged at any office or agency described below where Notes may be presented for
registration of transfer. The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of Holders of the Notes, issue additional
Notes ( Additional Notes ) ranking pari passu with, and with the same terms and provisions as, the Notes originally issued on [], 2019 (except for the date of original issuance, and, if applicable, the date from which
interest shall accrue, the first interest payment date, the offering and sale prices thereof and restrictions on transfer). Any such Additional Notes, together with the Notes originally issued on [], 2019, will constitute a single series of
Securities under the Indenture and will vote together as a single class on all matters to be voted on by the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture. 
The Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at any time or from time to time upon mailed notice to the
registered address of the Holder at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior to the redemption. Except as provided below, the Redemption Price will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and
(2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) on such Notes discounted to the date of redemption, on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of
twelve 30-day months), at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus [] basis points. Accrued interest will be paid to the date of redemption. All calculations
hereunder shall be made by the Company. Treasury Rate means, with respect to any Redemption Date for the Notes, the
rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third Business Day immediately preceding that redemption date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue (as defined below), assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury
Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date. 
Comparable Treasury Issue means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined
below) as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes, that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable
maturity to the remaining term of the Notes. Comparable Treasury Price means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the
Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations (as defined below) for that Redemption Date. Reference Treasury Dealer means
[] and its successors. If the Reference Treasury Dealer shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer, the Company will substitute another nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a primary U.S. Government
securities dealer. Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any
Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by the Reference Treasury
Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding that Redemption Date. 

Remaining Scheduled Payments means the remaining scheduled payments of
principal and interest on the Notes that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for that redemption. If that Redemption Date is not an interest payment date with respect to the Notes, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest
payment on the Notes will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued on the Notes to such Redemption Date. On and after any Redemption
Date, interest will cease to accrue on this Note or any portion of this Note called for redemption (unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest). On or before a Redemption Date, the Company will deposit
with the Paying Agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected in
accordance with the procedures of the Depositary, if applicable, or selected by the Trustee by a method the Trustee deems to be fair and appropriate if the Notes are not held through a Depositary with such procedures. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes that are due and payable on an Interest Payment Date falling on or prior to a
Redemption Date for the Notes shall be payable to the Holders of such Notes (or one or more Predecessor Securities) of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates referred to above, all as provided in the Indenture. 
All notices of redemption shall state the principal amount of Notes (including CUSIP/ISIN numbers) to be redeemed, the Redemption Date, the
Redemption Price or the method by which the Redemption Price shall be determined, if fewer than all the outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of Notes to be redeemed,
that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each Note (or portion thereof) to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date and the place or places where such
Notes maturing after the Redemption Date are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price. However, payment of the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest (if any) to but excluding the Redemption Date, for a Note for which a
redemption notice has been delivered is conditioned upon delivery of such Note (with, if the Company or the Trustee or any Paying Agent so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the
Trustee or such Paying Agent, as the case may be, duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) to the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in any Place of Payment for the Notes. Payment of
the Redemption Price for a Note (or portion thereof to be redeemed), together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date, will be made on the later of the Redemption Date or promptly following the time of delivery of such Note. 
If this Note is to be redeemed in part, this Note must be redeemed in a minimum principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000
in principal amount in excess thereof; provided that the unredeemed portion of this Note must be an authorized denomination. In the event
of redemption of this Note in part only, this Note must be surrendered at an office or agency maintained by the Company for that purpose and the Company will execute, and the Trustee or an authenticating agent will authenticate and deliver to the
Holder of this Note, without service charge and upon cancellation hereof, a new Note or Notes, of any authorized denominations as requested by the Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the
principal of this Note so surrendered. For all purposes of this Note and the Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all
provisions relating to the redemption by the Company of the Notes shall relate, in the case of any Notes redeemed or to be redeemed by the Company only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Notes which has been or is to be so
redeemed. If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared or,

The Walt Disney Company, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein referred to as the

interest thereon from [], 2019 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date (as defined below) to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually in arrears in equal installments on [] and [] of each year
(each, an Interest Payment Date ), commencing on [], [], at the rate of []% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest payments on this Note will include interest
accrued to but excluding the Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date, as the case may be. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture (as defined on the other side
of this Note), be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the preceding [] or [] (each, a Regular Record Date ), as the case may be

comprised of twelve 30-day months. Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any interest
not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein called Defaulted Interest ) will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the Regular Record Date with respect to such Interest Payment Date and
may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee (as defined on the

All payments of principal of, premium (if any), and interest on, the Notes will be payable in the coin or currency of the United States of
America. New York, New York is a Place of Payment for the Notes.

[]% Notes due [] 
This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Company (which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture
hereinafter referred to) issued and to be issued pursuant to such Indenture and designated by the Company as its []% Notes due [] (the Notes ). The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of the
Securities which may be issued thereunder. The Company issued this Note pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 20, 2019 (herein
called the Indenture ), among the Company, TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp., a Delaware Corporation, as guarantor, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (herein called the Trustee , which term includes any successor trustee
under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, each Guarantor, the Trustee
and Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Notes are in
registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 principal amount and integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like
aggregate principal amount of Notes of any authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same, upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged at any office or agency described below where Notes may be presented for
registration of transfer. The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of Holders of the Notes, issue additional
Notes ( Additional Notes ) ranking pari passu with, and with the same terms and provisions as, the Notes originally issued on [], 2019 (except for the date of original issuance, and, if applicable, the date from which
interest shall accrue, the first interest payment date, the offering and sale prices thereof and restrictions on transfer). Any such Additional Notes, together with the Notes originally issued on [], 2019, will constitute a single series of
Securities under the Indenture and will vote together as a single class on all matters to be voted on by the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture. 
The Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at any time or from time to time upon mailed notice to the
registered address of the Holder at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior to the redemption. Except as provided below, the Redemption Price will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and
(2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) on such Notes discounted to the date of redemption, on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of
twelve 30-day months), at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus [] basis points. Accrued interest will be paid to the date of redemption. All calculations
hereunder shall be made by the Company. On and after [], [], the Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of such Notes being redeemed to such date of redemption. 
Treasury Rate means, with respect to any Redemption Date for the Notes, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual
equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third Business Day immediately preceding that redemption date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue (as defined below), assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its
principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date. Comparable Treasury Issue means the
United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below) as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes, that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary
financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes, assuming the Notes matured on [], []. 
Comparable Treasury Price means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations (as defined
below) for that Redemption Date. Reference Treasury Dealer means [] and its successors. If the Reference
Treasury Dealer shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer, the Company will substitute another nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a primary U.S. Government securities dealer. 

Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations means, with respect to the Reference
Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by
the Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding that Redemption Date. 
Remaining Scheduled Payments means the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes that would be
due after the related Redemption Date but for that redemption, assuming the Notes matured on [], []. If that Redemption Date is not an interest payment date with respect to the Notes, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled
interest payment on the Notes will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued on the Notes to such Redemption Date. On and after any
Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on this Note or any portion of this Note called for redemption (unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest). On or before a Redemption Date, the Company will
deposit with the Paying Agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be
selected in accordance with the procedures of the Depositary, if applicable, or selected by the Trustee by a method the Trustee deems to be fair and appropriate if the Notes are not held through a Depositary with such procedures. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes that are due and payable on an Interest Payment Date falling on or prior to a
Redemption Date for the Notes shall be payable to the Holders of such Notes (or one or more Predecessor Securities) of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates referred to above, all as provided in the Indenture. 
All notices of redemption shall state the principal amount of Notes (including CUSIP/ISIN numbers) to be redeemed, the Redemption Date, the
Redemption Price or the method by which the Redemption Price shall be determined, if fewer than all the outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of Notes to be redeemed,
that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each Note (or portion thereof) to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date and the place or places where such
Notes maturing after the Redemption Date are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price. However, payment of the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest (if any) to but excluding the Redemption Date, for a Note for which a
redemption notice has been delivered is conditioned upon delivery of such Note (with, if the Company or the Trustee or any Paying Agent so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the
Trustee or such Paying Agent, as the case may be, duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) to the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in any Place of Payment for the Notes. Payment of
the Redemption Price for a Note (or portion thereof to be redeemed), together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date, will be made on the later of the Redemption Date or promptly following the time of delivery of such Note. 
If this Note is to be redeemed in part, this Note must be redeemed in a minimum principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000
in principal amount in excess thereof; provided , that, the unredeemed portion of this Note must be an authorized denomination. 
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, this Note must be surrendered at an office or agency maintained by the Company for that
purpose and the Company will execute, and the Trustee or an authenticating agent will authenticate and deliver to the Holder of this Note, without service charge and upon cancellation hereof, a new Note or Notes, of any authorized denominations as
requested by the Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of this Note so surrendered. 
For all purposes of this Note and the Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption by the
Company of the Notes shall relate, in the case of any Notes redeemed or to be redeemed by the Company only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Notes which has been or is to be so redeemed. 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared or, in certain
cases, automatically may become due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. 

The Indenture permits, in certain circumstances therein specified, the amendment thereof
without the consent of the Holders of the Securities. The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations under the Indenture of the Company and any
Guarantor and the rights of Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company, any Guarantor and the Trustee with the written consent of (i) the Holders of not less than a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities voting as a single class, or (ii) in case less than all of the several series of Securities are affected by such addition, change, elimination or modification, the Holders of not less than a
majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series so affected voting as a single class (including, for the avoidance of doubt, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange for, the
Securities). The Indenture also contains provisions permitting, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series to, by written consent, waive
compliance by the Company or any Guarantor with any provision of the Indenture (but solely insofar as such provision relates to the Securities of such series) or any provision of the Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the
Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such
consent or waiver is made upon this Note. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or, subject to the
provisions for satisfaction and discharge in Article VIII of the Indenture and the guarantee release provisions in Article XII of the Indenture, of the Indenture, shall alter or impair the obligations of the Company or any Guarantor, which are
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of Notes is registrable in the register of
Securities, upon surrender of a Note for registration of transfer at an office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in any Place of Payment for the Notes, which shall initially be the Corporate Trust Office of the Paying Agent in

No service charge shall be made by the Company, the Trustee or any Registrar for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the
Company may require, subject to certain exceptions specified in the Indenture, payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

The Walt Disney Company, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein referred to as the
Company ), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of [] dollars ($[]) on [], [] (the Maturity Date ) and to pay
interest thereon from [], 2019 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date (as defined below) to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually in arrears in equal installments on [] and [] of each year (each,
an Interest Payment Date ), commencing on [], [], at the rate of []% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest payments on this Note will include interest accrued to
but excluding the Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date, as the case may be. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture (as defined on the other side of this
Note), be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the preceding [] or [] (each, a Regular Record Date ), as the case may be (whether

prior to [], 2019, the Regular Record Date for such first Interest Payment Date will be the day immediately preceding such first Interest Payment Date (whether or not such day is a Business Day). If any Interest Payment Date, the Maturity
Date or any other date on which a payment on the Notes is due is not a Business Day, the payment due on such Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date or other date, as applicable, will be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and
effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date or other date, as applicable, and no additional interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date or other date, as
the case may be, to such next succeeding Business Day. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. 
Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein
called Defaulted Interest ) will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the Regular Record Date with respect to such Interest Payment Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more
Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee (as defined on the other side of this Note), notice of which shall be given to Holders of

required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. All payments of principal of, premium (if any), and interest on,
the Notes will be payable in the coin or currency of the United States of America. New York, New York is a Place of Payment for the

all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place. Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the

[]% Notes due [] 
This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Company (which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture
hereinafter referred to) issued and to be issued pursuant to such Indenture and designated by the Company as its []% Notes due [] (the Notes ). The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of the
Securities which may be issued thereunder. The Company issued this Note pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 20, 2019 (herein
called the Indenture ), among the Company, TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp., a Delaware Corporation, as guarantor and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (herein called the Trustee, which term includes any successor trustee under the
Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, each Guarantor, the Trustee and Holders
of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Notes are in registered form,
without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 principal amount and integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal
amount of Notes of any authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same, upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged at any office or agency described below where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer.
The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of Holders of the Notes, issue additional Notes ( Additional
Notes ) ranking pari passu with, and with the same terms and provisions as, the Notes originally issued on [], 2019 (except for the date of original issuance, and, if applicable, the date from which interest shall accrue, the
first interest payment date, the offering and sale prices thereof and restrictions on transfer). Any such Additional Notes, together with the Notes originally issued on [], 2019, will constitute a single series of Securities under the
Indenture and will vote together as a single class on all matters to be voted on by the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture. If an
Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared or, in certain cases, automatically may become due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. 
The Indenture permits, in certain circumstances therein specified, the amendment thereof without the consent of the Holders of the Securities.
The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations under the Indenture of the Company and any Guarantor and the rights of Holders of the Securities of
each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company, any Guarantor and the Trustee with the written consent of (i) the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities voting as a
single class, or (ii) in case less than all of the several series of Securities are affected by such addition, change, elimination or modification, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all
series so affected voting as a single class (including, for the avoidance of doubt, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange for, the Securities). The Indenture also contains provisions permitting, with certain
exceptions as therein provided, the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series to, by written consent, waive compliance by the Company or any Guarantor with any provision of the Indenture
(but solely insofar as such provision relates to the Securities of such series) or any provision of the Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all
future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or, subject to the provisions for satisfaction and discharge in Article
VIII of the Indenture and the guarantee release provisions in Article XII of the Indenture, of the Indenture, shall alter or impair the obligations of the Company or any Guarantor, which are absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and
interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. 

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the
transfer of Notes is registrable in the register of Securities, upon surrender of a Note for registration of transfer at an office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in any Place of Payment for the Notes, which shall initially be
the Corporate Trust Office of the Paying Agent in such Place of Payment, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company and the applicable Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the
designated transferee or transferees. Citibank, N.A., acting through its Corporate Trust Office currently located at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10013, and solely for the purpose of the transfer, surrender, exchange or presentation of Notes
for final payment, located at 480 Washington Boulevard, 30th Floor, Jersey City, New Jersey 07310, Attention: Securities Window The Walt Disney Company, will initially act as the Companys Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes in The
City of New York, New York, U.S.A. No service charge shall be made by the Company, the Trustee or any Registrar for any such registration
of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require, subject to certain exceptions specified in the Indenture, payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. 
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may
treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

The Walt Disney Company 
TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp. 
Registration Statement on Form S-4 
Ladies and Gentlemen: We have acted as counsel
for The Walt Disney Company, a Delaware corporation ( Disney ), and Disneys direct, wholly-owned subsidiary TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp., a Delaware corporation ( TWDC Enterprises ), in connection with the
preparation and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission ) of a registration statement on Form S-4 (the Registration Statement ) under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), relating to Disneys proposed issuance and offer to exchange any and all of the outstanding notes set forth on Annex A hereto and identified under the heading
Existing Notes (collectively, the Existing Notes ), issued by Disney, for consideration consisting of, with respect to each series of the Existing Notes, the principal amount described in the Registration Statement of
newly issued notes of Disney set forth across from such series of Existing Notes under the heading New Notes on Annex A hereto (collectively, the New Notes ). 
The New Notes are to be issued pursuant to the indenture (the Indenture ), dated as of March 20, 2019, among Disney, as
issuer, TWDC Enterprises, as guarantor, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the Trustee ). The New Notes are to be guaranteed (the Guarantee ) by TWDC Enterprises. 
In connection with this opinion, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such
corporate records, certificates of corporate officers and government officials and such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion, including: (i) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of
Disney, as amended; (ii) the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Disney; (iii) the 

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of TWDC Enterprises; (iv) the Amended and Restated Bylaws of TWDC Enterprises; (v) resolutions adopted by the board of directors of
Disney on October 3, 2018; (vi) resolutions adopted by the board of directors of TWDC Enterprises on September 28, 2018; (vii) the Registration Statement; (viii) the Indenture; and (ix) the forms of the New Notes. As to various
questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon representations of officers or directors of Disney and TWDC Enterprises and documents furnished to us by Disney and TWDC Enterprises without independent verification of their accuracy.
We have also assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity and competency of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and conformity to authentic original documents of all documents
submitted to us as copies. In expressing the opinions set forth herein, we have also assumed, with your consent, that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee and that the New Notes will conform to the forms of
notes examined by us. Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and assuming that (i) the Registration Statement and any supplements
and amendments thereto (including post-effective amendments) will have become effective and will comply with all applicable laws; (ii) the Registration Statement and any supplements and amendments thereto (including post-effective amendments)
will be effective and will comply with all applicable laws at the time the New Notes are offered or issued as contemplated by the Registration Statement; and (iii) all New Notes will be issued and sold in compliance with all applicable Federal
and state securities laws and in the manner stated in the Registration Statement and the prospectus related thereto, we are of the opinion that the New Notes have been duly authorized by Disney and when the New Notes are duly executed and
authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and issued and delivered in exchange for the applicable Existing Notes, (a) the New Notes will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Disney, enforceable against
Disney in accordance with their terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally from time to time in effect and to
general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (b) the Guarantee will constitute a
legal, valid and binding obligation of TWDC Enterprises, enforceable against TWDC Enterprises in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law). We express no opinion herein as to any provision of the Indenture or the New Notes that (a) relates
to the subject matter jurisdiction of any Federal court of the United States of America, or any Federal appellate court, to adjudicate any controversy related thereto, (b) contains a waiver of an inconvenient forum, (c) relates to the
waiver of rights to jury trial or (d) provides for indemnification, contribution or limitations on liability. We also express no opinion as to (i) the enforceability of the provisions of the Indenture or the New Notes to the extent such
provisions constitute a waiver of illegality as a defense to performance of contract obligations or any other defense to performance which cannot, as a matter of law, be effectively waived or (ii) whether a state court outside the State of New
York or a Federal court of the United States would give effect to the choice of New York law provided for in the Indenture or the New Notes.

We are admitted to practice only in the State of New York and express no opinion as to
matters governed by any laws other than the laws of the State of New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Federal laws of the United States of America. 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement. We also consent to the
reference to our firm under the caption Legal Matters in the prospectus constituting a part of the Registration Statement. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are experts within the meaning of Section 11

immediately preceding such first interest payment date. The terms of the Exchange Notes are substantially identical to the terms of the
corresponding series of the Original Notes, except that the Exchange Notes are registered under the Securities Act and the transfer restrictions, registration rights and payment of additional interest in case of
non-registration applicable to the Original Notes do not apply to the Exchange Notes. Pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the indenture, the Original Notes are, and the Exchange Notes will be,
guaranteed by TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp. ( TWDC Enterprises ). All references to the Original Notes and Exchange Notes include references to the related guarantees. 
In the event that (1) changes in law or in applicable interpretations thereof by the staff of the SEC do not permit the Company to effect
the Exchange Offer, (2) the applicable Exchange Offer is not consummated by 

June 17, 2020, or (3) any holder notifies the Issuer that it is not permitted by applicable law to participate in the Exchange Offers or participates in the Exchange Offer and does not
receive fully tradable Exchange Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offer, the Company will, at its expense, (a) cause to be filed with the SEC a shelf registration statement covering resales of the Original Notes of the applicable series within 90
days of the date the obligation to file a shelf registration statement arose and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shelf registration statement to be declared effective within 270 days of the date the obligation to file a shelf
registration statement arose and (b) use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement effective until the earlier of March 20, 2020 and the date all Original Notes covered by the shelf registration statement have
been sold as contemplated in the shelf registration statement or have ceased to be outstanding or otherwise registrable, with certain exceptions. 
In the event of the filing of the shelf registration statement, the Company will provide to each holder of the Original Notes of the
applicable series at least one conformed copy of each shelf registration statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, notify each such holder when the shelf registration statement has become
effective and take certain other actions as are required to permit unrestricted resales of the Original Notes of such series. A holder of Original Notes that sells its Original Notes pursuant to the shelf registration statement generally
(1) will be required to be named as a selling security holder in the related prospectus and to deliver a prospectus to purchasers, (2) will be subject to certain of the civil liability provisions under the Securities Act in connection with
such sales and (3) will be bound by the provisions of the registration rights agreement (including certain indemnification rights and obligations thereunder). In addition, each holder of the Original Notes will be required to deliver
information as required by the registration rights agreement to have their Original Notes included in the shelf registration statement and to benefit from the provisions regarding liquidated damages described in the following paragraph. 
In the event that the Company does not consummate the applicable exchange offer by June 17, 2020, the shelf registration statement is not
declared effective within 270 days of the date the obligation to file a shelf registration statement arose or the shelf registration statement ceases to be effective or usable for a period of time that exceeds 120 days in the aggregate in any 12-month period in which it is required to be effective under the registration rights agreement (each such event, a Registration Default ) then, subject to the terms of the registration rights
agreement, the interest rate borne by the applicable series of Original Notes will be increased by one quarter of one percent per annum for the first 90-day period while one or more Registration Default is
continuing and will increase to a maximum of one-half of one percent per annum while one or more Registration Default is continuing until all Registration Defaults have been cured. Upon the cure of all of the
Registration Defaults set forth above, the interest rate borne by the Original Notes of such series will be reduced to the original interest rate if the Company is otherwise in compliance with this paragraph; provided , however, that if, after
any such reduction in interest rate, certain events occur with respect to a different Registration Default, the interest rate on the applicable series of Original Notes may again be increased pursuant to the foregoing provisions. 
The Company reserves the right to extend any Exchange Offer at its discretion, in which event the term Expiration Date for such
Exchange Offer shall mean the latest time and date to which such Exchange Offer is extended. The Company will give oral or written notice of any extension to the Exchange Agent and, as promptly as practicable, to holders of Original Notes. 
This Letter is to be completed by a holder of Original Notes either if certificates for such Original Notes are forwarded herewith or if a
tender is to be made by book-entry transfer to the Exchange Agents account at The Depository Trust Company ( DTC ) in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Prospectus under the caption The Exchange
OffersProcedures for Tendering and an Agents Message (as defined below) is not delivered. Tenders of Original
Notes by book-entry transfer may also be made by delivering an Agents Message in lieu of this Letter. The term Agents Message means a message, transmitted by DTC to and received by the Exchange Agent and forming a part of a
Book-Entry Confirmation (as defined below), which states that DTC has received an express acknowledgment from the tendering participant in its Automated Tender Offer Program 

( ATOP ) stating that such participant has received and agrees to be bound by this Letter and that the Company may enforce this Letter against such participant. The term
Book-Entry Confirmation means a timely confirmation of a book-entry tender of Original Notes into the Exchange Agents account at DTC. 
Delivery of documents to DTC, the Trustee (as defined in the Prospectus under Description of Notes) or the Company does not
constitute delivery to the Exchange Agent. The method of delivery of Original Notes and this Letter and all other required documents
to the Exchange Agent is at the election and risk of the holders. Instead of delivery by mail, the Company recommends that holders use an overnight or hand delivery service. In all cases, holders should allow sufficient time to assure delivery to
the Exchange Agent before the Expiration Date. No Letter or Original Notes should be sent to the Company. The undersigned has completed
the appropriate boxes below and signed this Letter to indicate the action the undersigned desires to take with respect to the Exchange Offers.

full power and authority to tender, exchange, sell, assign and transfer the Original Notes it is tendering and that the Company will acquire good, marketable and unencumbered title to the Original Notes, free and clear of all security interests,
liens, restrictions, charges and encumbrances or other obligations relating to their sale or transfer and not subject to any adverse claim when the Original Notes are accepted by the Company, (ii) the Exchange Notes acquired in connection with
the Exchange Offers are being obtained in the ordinary course of business of the person receiving the Exchange Notes, (iii) it has not engaged in, does not intend to engage in, and has no arrangement or understanding with any person to
participate in the distribution, as defined in the Securities Act, of the Exchange Notes it will receive in the Exchange Offers and (iv) it is not an affiliate (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Company or TWDC
Enterprises. If the undersigned is a broker-dealer, the undersigned represents and acknowledges to the Company that it is not engaged in, and does not
intend to engage in, a distribution of the Exchange Notes, and that it will receive Exchange Notes for its own account in exchange for Original Notes that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading
activities and that it will be required to acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Notes; however , by so acknowledging and by delivering such a prospectus, the undersigned will not be
deemed to admit that it is an underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act (other than in connection with a resale of an unsold allotment from the original sale of the Original Notes). 

PLEASE READ THE ACCOMPANYING INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY 
Ladies and Gentlemen: Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Exchange Offers, the undersigned hereby tenders to the Company the aggregate principal amount of the Original Notes indicated above. Subject to, and effective upon, the acceptance for exchange of the Original Notes tendered hereby,
the undersigned hereby sells, assigns and transfers to, or upon the order of, the Company all right, title and interest in and to such Original Notes as are being tendered hereby. 
The undersigned hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Exchange Agent as the undersigneds true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact with respect to such tendered Original Notes, with full power of substitution, among other things, to cause the Original Notes to be assigned, transferred and
exchanged. The undersigned hereby represents and acknowledges to the Company that (i) it has full power and authority to tender, exchange, sell,
assign and transfer the Original Notes it is tendering and that the Company will acquire good, marketable and unencumbered title to the Original Notes, free and clear of all security interests, liens, restrictions, charges and encumbrances or other
obligations relating to their sale or transfer and not subject to any adverse claim when the Original Notes are accepted by the Company, (ii) the Exchange Notes acquired in connection with the Exchange Offers are being obtained in the ordinary
course of business of the person receiving the Exchange Notes, (iii) it has not engaged in, does not intend to engage in, and has no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution, as defined in the Securities
Act, of the Exchange Notes it will receive in the Exchange Offers and (iv) it is not an affiliate (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Company or TWDC Enterprises. 
If the undersigned is a broker-dealer, the undersigned represents and acknowledges to the Company that it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in,
a distribution of the Exchange Notes, and that it will receive Exchange Notes for its own account in exchange for Original Notes that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities and that it
will be required to acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Notes; however , by so acknowledging and by delivering such a prospectus, the undersigned will not be deemed to admit that it is
an underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act (other than in connection with a resale of an unsold allotment from the original sale of the Original Notes). 
The undersigned also acknowledges that the Exchange Offers are being made by the Company based upon the Companys understanding of interpretations by the
staff of the SEC as set forth in no-action letters issued to third parties, that the Exchange Notes issued in exchange for the Original Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers may be offered for resale, resold
and otherwise transferred by holders thereof, without compliance with the registration and prospectus delivery provisions of the Securities Act, provided that: (i) such holder is not an affiliate, as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act, of the Company or TWDC Enterprises; (ii) such Exchange Notes received by the undersigned are acquired in the ordinary course of the undersigneds business; and (iii) such holder is not engaged in, does not intend to
engage in, and has no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution, as defined in the Securities Act, of the Exchange Notes. 
However, the Company has not sought its own no-action letter and therefore the staff of the SEC has not considered the
Exchange Offers in the context of a no-action letter. There can be no assurance that the staff of the SEC would make a similar determination with respect to the Exchange Offers as in other circumstances. If a
holder of Original Notes is an affiliate of the Company or TWDC Enterprises, acquires the Exchange Notes other than in the ordinary course of such holders business or is engaged in or intends to engage in a distribution of the Exchange Notes
or has any arrangement or understanding with respect to the distribution of the Exchange Notes to be acquired pursuant to the Exchange Offers, such holder could not rely on the applicable interpretations of the staff of the SEC and must comply with
the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any secondary resale transaction. 

The undersigned will, upon request, execute and deliver any additional documents deemed by the Company to be
necessary or desirable to complete the sale, assignment and transfer of the Original Notes tendered hereby. All authority conferred or agreed to be conferred in this Letter and every obligation of the undersigned hereunder shall be binding upon the
successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators, trustees in bankruptcy and legal representatives of the undersigned and shall not be affected by, and shall survive, the death or incapacity of the undersigned. This tender may be withdrawn only
in accordance with the procedures set forth under the caption The Exchange OffersWithdrawal of Tenders section of the Prospectus. 
The Exchange Offers are subject to certain conditions as set forth in the Prospectus under the caption The Exchange OffersConditions to the
Exchange Offers . The undersigned recognizes that as a result of these conditions (which may be waived, in whole or in part, by the Company), as more particularly set forth in the Prospectus, the Company may not be required to exchange any
of the Original Notes tendered hereby and, in such event, the Original Notes not exchanged will be returned to the undersigned at the address shown above, promptly following the expiration or termination of the Exchange Offers. In addition, the
Company is not required to accept for exchange, or to issue the Exchange Notes in exchange for, any Original Notes and may terminate or amend the Exchange Offers at any time prior to the Expiration Date if any of the conditions set forth under
caption The Exchange OffersConditions to the Exchange Offers in the Prospectus occur. Unless otherwise indicated in the box
entitled Special Issuance Instructions below, please deliver the Exchange Notes in the name of the undersigned or, in the case of a book-entry delivery of Original Notes, please credit the Exchange Notes to be issued to the account
indicated above maintained at DTC. Similarly, unless otherwise indicated under the box entitled Special Delivery Instructions below, please send the Exchange Notes to the undersigned at the address shown above in the box entitled

Securities Act 
1. Delivery of this Letter and the Original Notes.

This Letter or, in lieu thereof, an Agents Message stating that the holder has expressly acknowledged receipt of, and agrees to be bound
by and held accountable by, this Letter, is to be completed by or received with respect to holders of Original Notes either if certificates are to be forwarded herewith or if tenders are to be made pursuant to the procedures for delivery by
book-entry transfer set forth in the The Exchange OffersProcedures for Tendering section of the Prospectus. Certificates for all physically tendered Original Notes (or Book-Entry Confirmation), as well as a properly
completed and duly executed Letter (or facsimile thereof) and any other documents required by this Letter (or, in lieu thereof, an Agents Message), must be received by the Exchange 

Agent at the address set forth herein on or prior to the Expiration Date. Original Notes tendered hereby must be in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
The method of delivery of this Letter, the Original Notes and all other required documents is at the election and risk of the tendering
holders. Instead of delivery by mail, it is recommended that holders use an overnight or hand delivery service. In all cases, sufficient time should be allowed to assure delivery to the Exchange Agent before the Expiration Date. No Letter or
Original Notes should be sent to the Company. Holders may request their respective brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies or nominees to effect the tenders for such holders. 
See The Exchange Offers section of the Prospectus. 

2. Partial Tenders (not applicable to holders of Original Notes who tender by book-entry transfer);
Withdrawals.
If less than all of the Original Notes evidenced by a submitted certificate are to be tendered, the
tendering holder(s) should fill in the aggregate principal amount of Original Notes to be tendered in the box Description of Original NotesPrincipal Amount Tendered. A newly reissued certificate for the Original Notes submitted but
not tendered will be sent to such holder as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date. All of the Original Notes delivered to the Exchange Agent will be deemed to have been tendered unless otherwise clearly indicated. 
A tender pursuant to the Exchange Offers may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Date. To be effective, a written or facsimile
transmission notice of withdrawal must: (i) be received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Expiration Date; (ii) specify the name of the person who deposited the Original Notes to be withdrawn; (iii) identify the Original Notes to be
withdrawn (including the certificate number(s), if any, and principal amount of such Original Notes); (iv) be signed by the depositor in the same manner as the original signature on this Letter by which such Original Notes were tendered (including
any required signature guarantees) or be accompanied by documents of transfer sufficient to have the trustee register the transfer of such Original Notes into the name of the person withdrawing the tender; and (v) specify the name in which any
such Original Notes are to be registered, if different from that of the depositor. The Exchange Agent will return the properly withdrawn Original Notes promptly following receipt of notice of withdrawal. If Original Notes have been tendered pursuant
to the procedure for book-entry transfer, any notice of withdrawal must specify the name and number of the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with the withdrawn Original Notes or otherwise comply with the Book-Entry Transfer
Facilitys procedures. All questions as to the validity of notices of withdrawal, including time of receipt, will be determined by the Company, in its sole discretion, and such determination will be final and binding on all parties. 

3. Signatures on this Letter, Bond Powers and Endorsements; Guarantee of Signatures.

If this Letter is signed by the registered holder(s) of the Original Notes tendered hereby, the signature must correspond exactly with the name
as written on the face of the certificates or on DTCs security position listing without alteration, enlargement or any change whatsoever. 
If any tendered Original Notes are owned of record by two or more joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter. 
If any tendered Original Notes are registered in different names on several certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as
many separate copies of this Letter as there are different registrations of certificates. When this Letter is signed by the registered
holder(s) (which term, for the purposes described herein, shall include the Book-Entry Transfer Facility whose name appears on a security listing as the owner of the Original Notes) of the Original Notes specified herein and tendered hereby, no
endorsements of certificates or separate bond powers are required. If, however, the Exchange Notes are to be issued to a person other than the registered holder(s), then endorsements of any certificates transmitted hereby or separate bond powers are
required. Signatures on such certificates must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution (as defined below). 

If this Letter is signed by a person other than the registered holder(s) of any Original
Notes specified therein, such certificate(s) must be endorsed by such registered holder(s) or accompanied by separate written instruments of transfer or endorsed in blank by such registered holder(s) in form satisfactory to the Company and duly
executed by the registered holder, in either case signed exactly as such registered holders or holders name(s) appear(s) on the Original Notes. 
If this Letter or any certificates of Original Notes or separate written instruments of transfer or exchange are signed or endorsed by
trustees, executors, administrators, guardians, attorneys-in-fact, officers of corporations or other persons acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such
persons should so indicate when signing and, unless waived by the Company, evidence satisfactory to the Company of their authority to so act must be submitted with this Letter. 
Signature on a Letter or a notice of withdrawal, as the case may be, must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution unless the Original Notes
are being or were tendered (i) by a registered holder who has not completed the box entitled Special Payment Instructions or Special Delivery Instructions on the Letter or (ii) for the account of an Eligible Institution. In
the event that signatures on a Letter or a notice of withdrawal, as the case may be, are required to be guaranteed, such guarantee must be by a financial institution (including most banks, savings and loan associations and brokerage houses) that is
a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program, the New York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature Program or the Stock Exchanges Medallion Program (each such entity an Eligible Institution ). 

4. Special Issuance and Delivery Instructions.

Tendering holders of Original Notes should indicate in the applicable box the name and address to which Exchange Notes issued pursuant to the
Exchange Offers are to be issued or sent, if different from the name or address of the person signing this Letter. In the case of issuance in a different name, the employer identification or social security number of the person named must also be
indicated. Holders tendering Original Notes by book-entry transfer may request that Original Notes not exchanged be credited to such account maintained at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility as such holder may designate hereon. If no such instructions
are given, such Original Notes not exchanged will be returned to the name or address of the person signing this Letter. 
5. Tax Identification Number and Backup Withholding.

An exchange of Original Notes for Exchange Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers will not be treated as a taxable exchange or other taxable
event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In particular, no backup withholding or information reporting is required in connection with such an exchange. However, U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that payments of principal and
interest on a note to a holder be subject to backup withholding unless such holder provides the payor with such holders correct Taxpayer Identification Number ( TIN ) or otherwise establishes a basis for an exemption. If the
holder is an individual, the TIN is his or her social security number. If the payor is not provided with the current TIN or an adequate basis for an exemption, the holder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service
( IRS ). In addition, the holder may be subject to backup withholding in an amount that is currently 24% of all reportable payments of principal and interest. 
Certain holders (including, among others, all corporations and certain foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and
information reporting requirements. These holders should nevertheless complete the attached Substitute Form W-9 below if they are U.S. persons, and check the box marked Exempt in Part 2, to avoid possible erroneous backup withholding.
However, if the holder is a nonresident alien or foreign entity not subject to backup withholding, the holder must provide a completed IRS Form W-8BEN (Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting
(Individuals)) or other appropriate IRS Form W-8. IRS Forms W-8 and W-9, and the instructions to such forms, may be obtained from the Exchange Agent or on the IRSs website, www.irs.gov . 
To prevent backup withholding on reportable payments of principal and interest, each holder must provide its correct TIN by completing the
Substitute Form W-9 set forth below, certifying that the TIN provided is 

correct (or that the holder is awaiting a TIN) and that (i) the holder is exempt from backup withholding, (ii) the holder has not been notified by the IRS that the holder is subject to a backup
withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest or dividends or (iii) the IRS has notified the holder that the holder is no longer subject to backup withholding. If the Original Notes are in more than one name or are not in the name of
the actual owner, the holder should consult the instructions to IRS Form W-9 for information on which TIN to report. If the holder does not have a TIN, the holder should consult the instructions to IRS Form W-9 for instructions on applying for a TIN
and check the box marked Applied for in Part 2 of the Substitute Form W-9. Checking this box means that the holder has already applied for a TIN or that the holder intends to apply for one in the near future. If a holder checks the box
marked Applied for in Part 2 of the Substitute Form W-9, backup withholding will nevertheless apply to all reportable payments made to the holder. If such a holder furnishes its TIN within 60 calendar days of the Exchange
Agents receipt of the Substitute Form W-9, however, any amounts so withheld shall be refunded to the holder. If backup withholding
applies, the payor will withhold the appropriate percentage (currently 24%) from payments to the holder. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the U.S. federal income tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be
reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained from the IRS. 
6. Transfer Taxes.

Holders who tender their Original Notes for Exchange Notes will not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes in connection therewith. If,
however, Exchange Notes are to be delivered to, or are to be issued in the name of, any person other than the registered holder of the Original Notes tendered hereby, or if tendered Original Notes are registered in the name of any person other than
the person signing this Letter, or if a transfer tax is imposed for any reason other than the exchange of Original Notes in connection with the Exchange Offers, the amount of any transfer taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder or any other
person) will be payable by the holder. If satisfactory evidence of payment of any such transfer taxes or exemption therefrom is not submitted herewith, the amount of such transfer taxes will be billed directly to the holder. 
Except as provided in this Instruction 6, it will not be necessary for transfer tax stamps to be affixed to the Original Notes. 

7. Waiver of Conditions.

The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to waive satisfaction of any or all conditions enumerated in the Prospectus at any time
and from time to time prior to the Expiration Date. 
8. No Conditional Tenders.

No alternative, conditional, irregular or contingent tenders will be accepted. All tendering holders of Original Notes, by execution of this
Letter or, in lieu thereof, an Agents Message, shall waive any right to receive notice of the acceptance of their Original Notes for exchange. 
None of the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person is obligated to give notice of any defect or irregularity with respect to any
tender of Original Notes nor shall any of them incur any liability for failure to give any such notice. 
9. Mutilated, Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Original Notes.

Any holder whose Original Notes have been mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed should contact the Exchange Agent at the address indicated above
for further instructions. 
10. Requests for Assistance or Additional Copies.

Questions relating to the procedure for tendering, as well as requests for additional copies of the Prospectus and this Letter, may be directed
to the Exchange Agent, at the address and telephone number indicated above.
